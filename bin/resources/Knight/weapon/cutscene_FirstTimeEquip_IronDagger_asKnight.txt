| Percival wipes the black ichor of the Gnawer off a small, rusted blade he pulled from its remains.
| It is an Iron Dagger. Crude, unadorned, but deceptively heavy.

[PERCIVAL]
"A dagger.
It’s barely a weapon compared to the sword. It looks like an eating utensil."

[NUGGET]
"Hey, don't knock the classics!
That is an Iron Dagger. It's not for dueling; it's for... 'problem solving.'
Specifically, problems that are very close to you and have soft spots."

[PERCIVAL]
(Flipping the dagger in his hand)
"It’s balanced. Good for a quick strike when there's no room to swing a sword.
Or for when I need to be quiet."

[NUGGET]
"Subtlety! I like it.
A loud sword says 'I am here to fight.' A hidden dagger says 'You are already dead.'
Keep it in your boot. You never know when you'll need a backup plan."

| Percival sheathes the small weapon. It disappears easily into his gear, an invisible reassurance.
