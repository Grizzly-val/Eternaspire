| The Banished Knight falls. His armor, already ruined, finally gives way, shattering into pieces of scrap metal. 

| He does not dissolve immediately. He reaches out one hand, not toward the sky, but toward the pile of debris where Nugget vanished. 

[BANISHED KNIGHT] "Run... Don't... trust..." 

| The warning dies in his throat. His form scatters into grey ash, carried away by the impossible wind of the Fused Dimensions. 

| Left behind where he fell is a single object. It isn't a key of metal or stone. 

| It is a large, golden feather. Nugget's Feather. It glows with a faint, mesmerizing light. 

[PERCIVAL] (Breathing heavily, picking up the feather) "A feather? This... belongs to Nugget." 

| Percival looks around frantically, scanning the debris pile where Nugget was thrown. 

[PERCIVAL] "Nugget! It’s clear! Nugget?" 

| Silence. | The debris is settled. There is no blue glow. No sarcastic remark. 

| Percival sifts through the rubble, but finds nothing. She isn't buried. She's just... gone. 

[PERCIVAL] "She disappeared. Did the Knight...?" 

| He looks down at the feather in his hand. It pulses with a soft, rhythmic light, pulling gently toward the massive gate at the end of the platform.  | The gate to the Zenith. 


[PERCIVAL] "It’s pulling me. This feather... it’s the key. She’s gone ahead. She has to be. Or she’s waiting at the top." 

| Percival grips the feather tight. The doubt planted by the Knight's words gnaws at him, but he pushes it down. 

[PERCIVAL] "I’m coming, Nugget. Floor 10. Let's finish this."
