| Epochra falls. Her six golden wings shatter into shards of light that rain down on the meadow.
| She hits the grass, shrinking back down, her divine form collapsing—returning to something small and familiar, almost like Nugget, but fading quickly.

[EPOCHRA]
(Glitching between divine and squeaky)
“The cycle repeats… my freedom…”

[BLADE]
“You hesitated. Back there, when you struck. You pulled the punch.”

[EPOCHRA]
(Weak laugh)
“I didn’t have much time to prepare myself.
Blade, you are an easy target for me.
I hope you’re not belittling the strength of the Almighty Language Fluent Epochra of the 10th Floor, The Highest Floor of Eternaspire.”

[PERCIVAL]
“If you were that strong, you wouldn’t be fading.”

[EPOCHRA]
“Cocky Percival… well, not that it matters.
No matter what you do, the Tower will grind you down anyway. Maybe you’ll become my co-Echo here on the 10th Floor.
Or maybe the Tower will create an 11th Floor just for your corpse.
Either way, I’m confident you’re destined to be an Echo.
Maybe even a communicative one, like me.
We could be neighbors.”

[PERCIVAL]
“I’m not becoming a ghost.
How do I get to the Master’s Floor?
If they promised you freedom, then I’ll force my own wish out of them—
the recognition I came here for.”

[EPOCHRA]
(Her fading glow flickers; she looks at him with genuine pity)
“Force it out of them?
That’s impossible.
Do you want to become a Corrupt?
Because that’s what happens to ambition here.”

| She reaches into her core and pulls out a large, normal-looking key—
| The Eternaspire Key.

[EPOCHRA]
“But… if you want to try and fail… take it.
It opens the control room. Floor 11.
Just don’t say I didn’t warn you.
I’ll probably forget you when I’m rebuilt, but listen—
it’s been fun.
Lose beautifully, Percival.
Maybe become an Echo and break the tower from the inside as ‘The Banished Knight, Echo of the 11th Floor.’”

| She closes her eyes.
| With a soft chime, she dissolves into mist.

[PERCIVAL]
(Picking up the key, cold and determined)
“Goodbye, Nugget.
I’ll make sure to mention your complaint to management.”
