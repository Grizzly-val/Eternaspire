[PERCIVAL]
"You…
You're the Tower Master?
You look like the thing I killed on Floor 0. Just… bigger."

[TOWER MASTER]
(The blob’s voice vibrates directly into Percival’s mind—flat, bored, almost annoyed.)
"Those? Mere husks. Auto-pilots.
I shed them the way humans shed skin.
You fought my leftovers."

| The Master morphs, forming a shimmering, half-hand that gestures lazily around the chamber.

[TOWER MASTER]
"I am the Prime State.
The original equation.
And you…
You’re the upstart who broke my caretaker. Epochra took centuries to tune properly."

[PERCIVAL]
"She wanted freedom. They all do.
I'm here to finish what she started—
to release the Echoes you archived like trophies.
And… I want my wish.
You said anyone who reached the top gets one."

[TOWER MASTER]
(The blob sighs; the room vibrates with the sound of steam escaping machinery.)
"The wish… yes, the promotional tagline.
Mortals love dramatic incentives."

| The Master reaches inside itself and pulls out a glistening, dripping sack.
| It crashes onto the floor with a wet thud.
| Gold spills out—bright, legitimate, unmistakably valuable, yet covered in rainbow slime.

[TOWER MASTER]
"Here.
Wealth. Documentation. Tangible proof that you conquered the Tower.
Take this down the mountain, flash it at your kingdom,
and they will write your name in every book."

[PERCIVAL]
(He watches the coins roll and clink.)
"...You’re bribing me?"

[TOWER MASTER]
"I’m preventing paperwork.
Listen carefully, variable:
I can delete you—cleanly, painlessly, instantly.
But if we fight, this chamber breaks, systems fail,
and I have to recalibrate everything.
Tedious. Wasteful."

| The blob gestures at the screens displaying Echoes—frozen memories of the Paladin, the Knight, Aeliana… Nugget.

[TOWER MASTER]
"So take the gold.
Go home.
Become the hero you want people to believe you are.
Recognition without risk.
A reputation pre-packaged for convenience."

| Percival nudges the sack with his boot.
| It slides across the floor, leaving a slimy streak behind.

[PERCIVAL]
"Recognition earned through a shortcut isn’t recognition at all."

| He grips his weapon. The blade crackles, hungry, alive.

[PERCIVAL]
"You don’t get to decide what my name means.
And I’m not leaving with your pity-money."

| He levels his weapon at the Prime State.

[PERCIVAL]
"I climbed this tower to prove myself.
And I’m proving it by shutting you down."
