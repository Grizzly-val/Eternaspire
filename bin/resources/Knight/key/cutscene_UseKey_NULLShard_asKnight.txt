| Percival stands at the edge of The Chasm of Echoes. Ahead lies a bridge of stars leading to a massive, floating graveyard of planets.
| He holds the NULL Shard. It is a piece of pure black void that feels heavier than the planet itself.

[PERCIVAL]
"This key... it's not metal or stone. It's just... empty space given shape."

[NUGGET]
"It unlocks The Stellar Graveyard.
Where dead stars go to... well, not shine.
Insert it into the rift."

| Percival places the shard into a tear in reality. The rift widens, revealing the path forward. He pauses, looking down at Nugget.

[PERCIVAL]
"Hey, Nugget."

[NUGGET]
"Yeah, Boss? Ready for the space walk?"

[PERCIVAL]
"I just wanted to say... thanks.
I know I gave you a hard time at the start. But I wouldn't be here without you.
You're a good guide."

| Nugget freezes. Her wings stop fluttering for a second. She looks away, her glow dimming significantly.

[NUGGET]
"I...
Yeah. Sure. That's my job.
Don't get sappy on me, Percival. We're not done yet."

[PERCIVAL]
"I'm serious. When this is over, I owe you one."

[NUGGET]
(Voice barely a whisper)
"You don't owe me anything."
