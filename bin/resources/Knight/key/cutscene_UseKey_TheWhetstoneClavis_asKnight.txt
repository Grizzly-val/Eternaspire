| Percival stands before a heavy, sealed gate at the end of the hall. The surface is seamless black stone, save for a single, jagged indentation in the center.
| He holds up The Whetstone Clavis. It doesn't look like a standard key—it looks like a shard of crystallized flint, razor-sharp on all edges.

[PERCIVAL]
"This is a key? It looks more like a flat stone.
There's no handle. How am I supposed to turn it?"

[NUGGET]
"Carefully?
The Tower doesn't believe in safe passage, Percival. Even opening a door requires a little... investment."

[PERCIVAL]
(Frowning at the jagged slot)
"Investment... right."

| Percival aligns the stone shard with the indentation. There is no leverage point. To turn it, he has to grip the stone itself.
| He takes a breath, clenches his hand around the sharp edges, and twists.
| A thin line of red runs down his wrist, mixing with the mechanism. The stone drinks it in.

[NUGGET]
"Ooh, primal.
Blood for access. Very classic dungeon aesthetic."

| The gate shudders. A deep, tectonic grinding sound echoes as the heavy stone slabs slowly groan apart, revealing a spiral staircase winding upward into the gloom.

[PERCIVAL]
(Wrapping his hand with a scrap of cloth)
"It's open.
And my hand still works, though wounded"

[NUGGET]
"And there we go! The path to Floor 1: The Platform of Nadir is open.
'Nadir' means the lowest point—rock bottom. So technically, there's nowhere to go but up!"
