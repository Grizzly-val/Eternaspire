| Percival stands at the edge of a narrow stone walkway suspended over an infinite black void.
| Blocking his path is a massive gate, but it has no hinges and no bars. Instead, it is held shut by a crackling barrier of solidified magical tension.
| He pulls out The Latch Breaker. It’s a heavy, iron rod with a squared-off head—ugly, blunt, and completely unrefined.

[PERCIVAL]
"Another gate, another problem.
But this 'key' doesn't have teeth. It’s just a lump of iron.
There’s no keyhole here, Nugget. Just this... humming wall."

[NUGGET]
"That’s because it’s not a lock, silly. It’s a binding.
The Suspension Gate isn't locked; it’s stuck. Frozen in tension.
You don't finesse a problem like this. You shock it."

[PERCIVAL]
(Weighing the heavy iron rod in his hand)
"So it's not a key. It's a hammer."

[NUGGET] "Tomayto, tomahto. In this tower, 'opening' sometimes usually means 'breaking' something efficiently. Aim for the center node. That glowing spot where the tension is tightest. And give it a good whack! Don't be shy!"

| Percival grips the Latch Breaker like a mace. He steps back, muscles tensing, and swings the blunt instrument with full force into the center of the barrier.
| CRACK!
| The sound is like a gunshot. The iron rod shatters upon impact, turning into dust.
| But the barrier shatters with it. The tension snaps, and the magical wall explodes outward in a harmless shower of sparks.

[NUGGET]
"Nice swing, Boss!
The gate is open.
Or... well, broken. But open!
The path leads to Floor 8: The Suspension Gate."

| The barrier dissolves completely, revealing a precarious path of floating stones drifting slightly in the void's currents.
| Percival sheathes his sword, testing the first stone with his boot. It holds, but feels unnatural.

[PERCIVAL]
"Nugget."

[NUGGET]
"Yeah, Boss?"

[PERCIVAL]
"You talk about the Tower like you've seen a thousand people stand exactly where I am.
You know where the traps are. You know how the keys work.
So tell me... do you actually care if I reach the top? Or are you just the one keeping score?"

[NUGGET]
(Hovering closer, his usual frantic energy stilling for a split second)
"If I just wanted to see you die, I wouldn't have told you to dodge that blob earlier.
I want to see how far you can go. That is much more... entertaining.
Besides, the view from the top is boring if you're alone."

[PERCIVAL]
(Eyebrows narrowing)
"Right. 'Entertainment'."

[NUGGET]
(Spinning in the air, cheerful tone returning instantly)
"Exactly! Speaking of which, don't get too comfortable.
This area is crawling with Gnawers. Nasty little rats.
One of them swallowed the next key, The Disfragmenter. You'll need that to fix the bridge to the next zone.

Oh! And keep an eye out for a Water Pocket. There's a... secret."
