| Percival stands at the edge of the Nexus platform. The white gate to the next floor hums with a blinding, silent intensity.
| He holds the Key of Absolution. It feels lighter now, the crushing weight of the Paladin's grief gone.

[PERCIVAL]
"So that's it. The 'Key of Absolution'.
He thought this would fix everything. It just opened a door."

[NUGGET]
"Doors are useful! Much better than walls.
And hey, at least he went out smiling. That's a win in my book.
Sad, tragic, slightly traumatizing... but a win!"

| Percival looks at the key, then turns his gaze to the small, fluttering creature beside him.

[PERCIVAL]
"Nugget."

[NUGGET]
"Yes, Boss? Ready to ascend? The air up there is supposed to be... actually, I don't know what it is. Probably spicy."

[PERCIVAL]
"Who are you?"

[NUGGET]
(Blinking, hovering in a confused circle)
"I'm Nugget! Your guide! The charm! The comic relief!
We've been over this."

[PERCIVAL]
"I kinda got the gist of that. But what are you thinking of right now?
Bringing me to the tower; helping me; teaching me about the keys and the monsters... why are you doing this?
And why do you know so much about a place that kills everyone else?"

| Nugget stops moving. She hovers perfectly still for a second, her blue light dimming slightly, before brightening again with a casual shrug.

[NUGGET]
"Well... basically, I'm like the usual visitor of this tower. Just another tourist!"

[PERCIVAL]
"A tourist who knows where all the bodies are buried?"

[NUGGET]
"I read the brochure!
But look, as you can see, with my tiny wings, I can't do much. I can't lift swords, I can't fight cactus-monsters.
So... I look for people like you. People with drive. People who are willing to come and see the top."

[PERCIVAL]
(Deadpan)
"But you forced me."

[NUGGET]
"Hehe."

| Percival stares at her. Nugget offers nothing else, just that small, mischievous giggle that somehow dismisses the kidnapping entirely.

[PERCIVAL]
(Sighing and shaking his head)
"You're impossible.
Fine. You're a tourist with a kidnapping habit. Let's go."
