| Percival draws his sword instinctively, turning toward the intruder.
| A small, golden, spherical creature is shaking glass shards out of its wings.

[PERCIVAL]
"Identify yourself! Assassin? Spy?"

[NUGGET]
"Whoa, easy with the pointy stick, Sir Clanks-a-Lot!
I'm Nugget! Just... passing through.
And wow, tough room back there. 'Clean your armor'? Ouch. That woman is colder than a winter frost."

[PERCIVAL]
(Lowering the sword slightly, confused)
"You... heard that?"

[NUGGET]
"Hard not to. The disappointment was radiating through the walls.
So, that's the deal? You break your back, win the gold, and she treats you like the help?"

[PERCIVAL]
"It is the burden of my house. I must be perfect."

[NUGGET]
"Newsflash, buddy: To her, 'perfect' just means 'invisible.'
She doesn't care about what you win. She cares that you're not more."

| Percival looks down at the twisted wreath on the floor.

[PERCIVAL]
"I don't know what else to do. I've won everything there is to win here."

[NUGGET]
"Exactly! Here!
Small pond. Small trophies.
If you want to impress someone like that... you need something impossible.
Something legendary.
Something that says, 'I am greater than this entire family.'"

[PERCIVAL]
"Impossible? Like what?"

[NUGGET]
"Like the Tower.
You know the one. The big spooky spire on the horizon?
They say whoever conquers it gets a wish.
Imagine that. You could wish for... oh, I don't know... 'The Greatest Kingdom in History'? Or maybe just... 'To be Acknowledged'?"

| Percival stares at the creature. The anger in his chest shifts into something else. Ambition.

[PERCIVAL]
"The Eternaspire...
If I conquered that... she couldn't look away. No one could."

[NUGGET]
"Precisely!
So, what do you say? Ditch the family drama, grab your sword, and let's go make history.
I need a bodyguard, and you need a miracle."
