| The air smells of ozone and rotting cactus.
| Ahead, a familiar shape wobbles into view. It’s a Spinefiend, but the majestic mustache is gone, replaced by a void of static.
| Its spines aren't needles anymore—they are long, jagged tears in reality that drift around it.

[CHALLENGER]
"Is that... the cactus thing?
It looks like it was drawn by a madman."

[NUGGET]
"Corrupted Spinefiend.
It lost its style. Now it’s just a texture error with spikes.
Don't touch the black floating spines, Blade. They don't poke you; they erase the part of you they touch."

| The creature shudders, and the hallway momentarily turns upside down.

[CHALLENGER] "It’s destabilizing the room just by existing, and it’s not posing."

[NUGGET]
"Then stop it from existing!"
