| Blade steps onto a floating island of rock. Above and below, there is no sky, only a swirling vortex of grey static and deleted data.
| Suddenly, the empty air beside him ripples.
| A creature bursts out of the void as if breaking the surface of water. It is a Corrupted Drowner, but it isn't swimming in water—it's swimming through the empty space itself.
| Its body is flickering, half-rendered, with textures stretching into infinity.

[BLADE]
"It’s swimming in the air.
And it looks... unfinished."

[NUGGET]
"The physics engine is broken here, Blade.
Gravity, density, water... it's all just code now. And that code is rotting.
That Drowner thinks the air is an ocean. Don't let it drag you into the 'deep'—there's no bottom to this floor."

| The creature gurgles—a sound of distorted audio feedback—and dives at them, its rotting hands phasing through a floating rock to grab at Blade.

[BLADE]
"It’s phasing through the cover!"

[NUGGET]
"Walls are suggestions up here! Hit it before it drags you into the recycle bin!"
