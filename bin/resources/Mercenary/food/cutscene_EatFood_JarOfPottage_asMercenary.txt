| Blade opens the heavy chest found in the corner of the room. Inside sits a single, sealed clay jar.
| He breaks the wax seal. A cloud of steam rises into the cold air, carrying the smell of roasted root vegetables and savory broth.

[BLADE]
(Staring at the steam)
"It’s hot.
This chest is covered in centuries of dust, but the soup inside is boiling.
How is that possible?"

[NUGGET]
"Welcome to the Tower’s pantry!
See, when the Tower pulls something in—a city, a room, a person—it takes a snapshot.
Sometimes, it preserves the monsters. Sometimes, it preserves the lunch."

[BLADE]
"So this is... ghost soup? A memory of a meal?"

[NUGGET]
"It’s real food, Blade. It’s just been paused until you opened the lid.
The Tower provides for those who climb. It wants you healthy enough to reach the next death trap.
Go on. Eat. It’s better than starving."

| Blade hesitates, then takes a spoonful. The warmth spreads through his chest instantly, chasing away the chill of the floor.

[BLADE]
"It tastes... like home.
Simple. Hearty.
I guess I can't complain about the logic if it keeps me alive."

[NUGGET]
"Exactly! Don't question the magic catering. Just enjoy the pottage."
