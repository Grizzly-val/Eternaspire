| Blade finds a small pastry wrapped in wax paper. It smells sweet and sharp, like wild berries.

(Taking a bite)
"Tart. Very tart.
It makes my head spin a little."

[NUGGET]
"That’s an Echo Berry. They grow in the cracks where the reality is thin.
It replenishes your focus. Good for the mind, bad for the sweet tooth."

[BLADE]
"It tastes like static electricity and sugar.
But I feel sharper."
