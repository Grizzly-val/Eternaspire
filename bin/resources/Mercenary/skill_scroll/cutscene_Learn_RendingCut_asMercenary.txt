| Blade unrolls the weather-beaten scroll he looted from the pile of dust that was once the Lost Vanguard.
| The parchment is stiff, smelling of old iron and dried blood.

[CHALLENGER]
"This was his. The Vanguard's.
'A Blade's Manual.'
It’s surprisingly... simple. No magic runes, just diagrams of strikes."

[NUGGET]
"That’s because he wasn't a mage, Blade. He was a soldier.
Soldiers don't have time for fancy incantations. They need things that work when they're tired, bleeding, and outnumbered."

[CHALLENGER]
(Tracing a diagram of a heavy, downward slash)
"This move... it puts everything into one strike.
It disregards defense entirely to tear through armor."

[NUGGET]
"Irony is a funny thing, isn't it?
The man who held the shield forever... his only special technique was a move that left him wide open.
Maybe that’s why he fell. Or maybe that’s how he kept them safe for so long—by making sure the enemy couldn't hit back."

| Blade grips the parchment. It crumbles into silver light, flowing into his hands and hardening his grip.
| He feels the muscle memory of a thousand desperate parries and one decisive counter-attack imprint itself onto his mind.

[SYSTEM MESSAGE]

SKILL LEARNED: Rending Cut
(Active) A heavy, armor-piercing strike that deals massive damage but leaves the user momentarily vulnerable.

[CHALLENGER]
(Clenching his fist)
"He fought to protect.
I'll use it to survive.
Different reasons, same swing."

[NUGGET]
"Well said. Just make sure you don't end up as a statue like him.
I prefer my champions lively and less... dusty."
