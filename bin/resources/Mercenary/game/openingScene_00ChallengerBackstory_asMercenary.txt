| Before there were stories, there was a fracture.
| Some say the world split by accident. Others whisper it was carved open on purpose.
| No one agrees—only that something tore the sky from its reflection.

| From that wound rose a structure no one remembers building.
| A tower older than memory, taller than truth.
| It reaches upward… or downward… depending on who is telling the tale.

| Travelers speak of its pull. Not a voice, not a prophecy—just a quiet pressure at the edge of thought.
| And today, as the horizon thins and the air hums with an old tension, one more soul feels that pull.

| ...

| The smell of rusted iron, sweat, and cheap tobacco fills the cramped transport wagon.
| Blade is jolted awake by a rough hand shoving his shoulder.

[MERCENARY COMPANION]
"-lade...?
Blade!
BLADE!!"

| Blade gasps, disoriented, his hand instinctively reaching for a weapon that isn't there.

[MERCENARY COMPANION]
"Tsk! You sure are enjoying the sleep of your life, huh?
Wait... are those tears?
Hah! You're actually crying? Crying in your sleep, what are you? A kid?"

| Blade touches his cheek. It's wet. He wipes it away quickly, his expression hardening.

[MERCENARY COMPANION]
"Let me guess, is it about your mom again? Sigh. You poor kid.
Like what I always tell you:
Just keep doing a good job with the requests thrown at us and you'll eventually be able to afford her treatment.
That is if you don't die, hahaha!"

| The laughter fades as the wagon rumbles on. Blade stares out the back, clutching a small pouch of coins—his share of the reward.


| Challenger : Blade



| Age : 21



| Job : Mercenary



| ...

| Later. The sterile silence of a hospital hallway.
| Blade stands outside a room, gripping the pouch tight.

[BLADE]
(Whispering to himself)
"One more contract… and maybe, just maybe, I'll be able to afford the next dose."

| A soft cough echoes from the room. Blade’s eyes widen, and he rushes through the door.

[BLADE]
"Mom!"

[BLADE'S MOM]
(Smiling weakly, hiding a bloody handkerchief)
"Haha, gotcha! I knew coughing loud would get you to come here.
I'm sorry, Blade. I had to resort to that method 'cause I missed my son so much."

[BLADE]
"Mom, this is no time to be joking!
Blood's coming out of your mouth... you cough out blood almost every day.
How can you be so relaxed?!"

[BLADE'S MOM]
"Did you not learn from your dad?
He may not be here with us now, but I'm a firm believer in his way of life.
I firmly believe that 'If the Reaper is coming for the bill, I won't pay in silence.'
I'm just laughing my way to the grave, son. That way, I'm also running away from it. Smart, aren't I?"

[BLADE]
"Don't joke about that! Just stop talking and rest, Mom."

| Silence fills the room. The only sound is the ragged breathing from the bed.

[BLADE'S MOM]
"I'm already filled with plenty of happiness, Blade.
I had such a loving husband. I lived in a warm, comfortable home.
And now, I get to see my son deeply express his love towards me and care for me almost everyday."

| She reaches out, her frail fingers tracing the fresh bruises on his arm.

[BLADE'S MOM]
"...Except for the days you're out on your job.
Blade, did you think I wouldn't notice?
You can forget about me, Blade! You are capable of so much more!
Go live your life!"

| Tears stream down her face, her voice cracking.

[BLADE'S MOM]
"Go quit that job, Blade. Mom's begging you.
Cut ties with those dangerous people!
Don't throw your life away for me... just let me die peacefully with no regrets!"

[BLADE]
"How could I possibly do that?! I can't just—"

| SLAM!
| "OWIEE!"

| Amidst the heated argument, a small, blurry projectile comes flying from afar, slamming violently into the hospital window.
| The glass vibrates with the impact. Blade and his mother both freeze, wiping their tears in confusion.

[BLADE]
"I'll... go check."
