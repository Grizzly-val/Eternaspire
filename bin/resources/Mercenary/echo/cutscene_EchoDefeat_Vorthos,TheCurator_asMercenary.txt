| Blade lands the final blow on the frozen throne.
| A hairline fracture appears on Vorthos's chest. It spreads instantly, spiderwebbing across his frozen skin and the black ice throne.

[VORTHOS]
"Perfection... achieved.
Silence... at... last."

| With a sound like a thousand windows breaking at once, Vorthos explodes.
| He doesn't bleed. He shatters into millions of diamond-dust particles, drifting slowly to the floor.
| The massive needle he wielded clatters to the ice, shrinking down to a wieldable size.

[BLADE]
(Exhaling a cloud of white mist)
"He wanted stillness. He got it."

[NUGGET]
"He was obsessed with preserving things forever.
Now he's just snow.
Poetic justice is cold, isn't it?"

| Blade walks over to the weapon left behind.
