| Blade enters the final arena of The Fused Dimensions. Reality here is a chaotic swirl of every previous floor—sand mixing with ice, clockwork gears grinding against fleshy walls.
| Standing in the center is a warrior. He wears armor that is battered, broken, and scorched, but the silhouette is undeniably familiar. He holds a sword that looks like a shattered version of the Galactic Severance.

[BLADE]
"Hey Nugget, that looks like an Echo. Should I make my move?"

| Nugget does not float forward. She freezes, her wings locking up. Her voice shrinks into a high-pitched shriek of genuine terror.

[NUGGET]
"It's that same feeling..."

[BLADE]
"Finally, you've responded. What feeling?"

[NUGGET]
"Blade, be sure to defeat that. That's the Banished Knight."

[BLADE]
"Y-yeah, of course? That's what we've been doing right? We knock them down, we move up."

[NUGGET]
"Yeah, you're right. And you'll go to the tenth floor."

[BLADE]
"Ye-Yeah? And I will cure my mother, right? That's the deal."

| Guilt rushes into Nugget again, then turns to him. Her blue light is trembling violently.

[NUGGET]
"Y-yeah... you should be smarter, Blade."

[BLADE]
"Hey! That's an insult. I've gotten us this far."

[NUGGET]
"Yeah, because you are stupid... An idiot... A fool."

[BLADE]
"W—"

| Before Blade can finish, the Banished Knight snaps his head up. He sees Nugget.
| A roar of pure, unfiltered hatred erupts from the helmet.
| The Knight moves faster than any Echo before him. He ignores Blade entirely, blurring into a streak of steel aimed directly at the floating companion.

[BANISHED KNIGHT] "DECEIVED!"

| CRASH.
| The impact sends shockwaves through the reality-warped floor. Blade is blown back by the wind pressure.
| When the dust clears, the Knight is standing where Nugget was.
| Nugget is gone. On the far right of the arena, a pile of debris shifts, but there is no sign of the blue light.

[BLADE]
"Nugget!"

| Blade turns back to the Knight, his grip tightening on the Galactic Severance until his knuckles turn white.

[BLADE]
"You... you cheap-shotting armor pile.
She’s just a guide!"

| The Knight turns slowly to Blade. He doesn't attack immediately. He looks at Blade with a confusing mixture of rage and pity.

[BANISHED KNIGHT]
(Voice raspy, sounding like a man who hasn't spoken in eons)
"Mother... Upset...
Nugget... Forgive... Friend..."

[BLADE]
"The guy below spouted the same stuff. Two floors in a row of Echoes that resemble me...
Except this time, I'm really, really pissed off!"

| Blade charges, the cosmic energy of his sword flaring violently.
