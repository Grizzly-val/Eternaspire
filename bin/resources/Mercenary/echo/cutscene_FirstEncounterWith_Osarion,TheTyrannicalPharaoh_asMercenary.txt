| Blade steps onto the final platform inside the Pyramid. The room is vast, filled with gold that has dulled under the weight of stagnant time.
| Upon a massive, decaying stone throne sits a colossal figure clad in ancient armor.
| It does not look at Blade. It looks past him, staring at an empty spot on the floor.

[OSARION, THE TYRANNICAL PHARAOH]
(Voice booming, but mechanical, like a record skipping)
"Bring the... stone. Higher. The sun... must not... set."
"More... labor. More... blood."
"I am... eternal."

[BLADE]
"He’s huge. But he's talking to ghosts.
He doesn't even know we're here."

[NUGGET]
(Hovering with crossed arms, looking disgusted)
"He knows nothing. That is Osarion.
The man who sold his entire kingdom to the Tower just so he wouldn't have to die.
He wished to rule forever. So the Tower gave him an empty room and a crown that he can never take off."

| Osarion slams his scepter down. A shockwave of golden dust blasts outward, not as an attack, but as a reflex.

[OSARION]
"Kneel! Tribute! My... legacy!"

[BLADE]
"He’s trapped in his own ego."

[NUGGET]
"He’s a parasite. He fed on his people to build this place, and now he's just a hollow shell guarding a pile of rocks.
He’s not tragic, Blade. He’s pathetic.
Go knock him off that high chair. He’s been sitting there long enough."
