| Blade stands before a seamless wall of dark obsidian ice. There is no door, only a geometric indentation.
| He holds up The Black Ice Prism. When he looks through it, the wall vanishes, revealing a twisting spiral staircase behind it.

[BLADE]
"It’s an illusion. The prism filters it out.
Clever."

[NUGGET]
(Quietly)
"It’s not an illusion. It’s a memory of a wall.
The prism just reminds it that it's broken."

[BLADE]
"That sounds poetic. And depressing.
You're usually making a joke about breaking and entering by now."

[NUGGET]
"This floor... it’s heavy.
Just put the prism in the slot, Blade. Let's get out of this hallway."

| Blade inserts the prism. The dark ice shatters silently, the shards dissolving into mist before they hit the floor.
| The path to The Heartfrost Spire is open.

| Blade scoops up a handful of glowing, gelatinous substance from a frozen puddle. It pulses with a faint, sick green light.

[BLADE]"Look, Nugget, I took some Bioluminescent Jelly from earlier. It smells like ozone and... wet copper. Well, down the hatch."

| He swallows it. He immediately violently shudders, his face contorting.

[BLADE] "Gah! It tastes like battery acid mixed with lightning! My tongue is numb. Is it supposed to be numb? Nugget? Hey, floating encyclopedia? Am I poisoned?"

| Nugget is hovering near the wall, staring blankly at a patch of black ice. He doesn't respond.

[BLADE] "Oi. Nugget."

[NUGGET] (Snapping out of it, blinking rapidly) "Huh? What? Oh! Jelly! Yes! Very nutritious. Full of... electrolytes. Good for the nerves."

| Blade wipes his mouth, eyeing the companion suspiciously.

[BLADE] "You zoned out. You never zone out."

[NUGGET] "Just... thinking. About the view. Lots of ice. Very shiny. Are you gonna finish that or just complain?"

[BLADE] "I'm done. Are you okay?"

[NUGGET] (Turning away, floating ahead quickly) "Never been better! Come on, let’s enter The Heartfrost Spire Chop chop!"
