| Blade stands before a low, squat stone door, half-buried in a dune. It's an ordinary lock, unlike the previous ascent gates. | 

He pulls out the Gate Key, a tarnished brass key retrieved from a pile of rubble on a lower floor.

[CHALLENGER] "A door in the sand. Seems out of place. Not exactly a grand entrance for the 'Ruined Kingdom of Neferis'."

[NUGGET] "It's the Tower's way of saying, 'Surprise!' Go on, Mercenary. This key wasn't meant to open the floor, but to open a secret within the floor."

| Blade inserts the common brass key into the lock. He turns it. It clicks with an audible finality. | 

The door does not swing open. Instead, the sand around the entire structure begins to shudder.

[CHALLENGER] "What was that? An avalanche?"

[NUGGET] "Look up, Blade! Look at the architecture!"

| With a grinding, deafening roar, the massive dunes surrounding the door begin to shift, not falling, but rising. | 

Huge stone walls, pillars, and shattered marble monuments rise from beneath the sand, clicking into place like colossal, forgotten clockwork. In seconds, the wide-open desert is replaced by the narrow, sand-choked canyons of an ancient, perfectly preserved city—the heart of Neferis.

[CHALLENGER] (Staring at the impossibly emerging stone, his voice hushed) "It was... down there. The whole city. The Tower is moving the landscape around us. It's hiding entire worlds in plain sight."

[NUGGET] (His voice serious, echoing the awe of the moment) "The desert is the Tower's veil, Blade. The sand is the distraction. This is Neferis. A whole civilization, ripped from its reality and stored here, ready to be deployed. The Tower is an editor of existence. Now you're walking in the space between the pages."

[CHALLENGER] (Drawing his weapon, eyes sweeping the new, shadowed city street) "Ripped apart or not, the challenge is still the same. I just need to find the top of this wretched place."
