| Blade stands in front of the passage linked to the floor above. The reality here is barely holding together. The walls flicker between stone and wireframe. | The gate to the next floor is a void—a perfect, two-dimensional black circle that hurts to look at. | He holds The Void Sigil, a symbol that seems to absorb the dim light of the room.

"The next floor doesn't have a door. It just has... a hole."

[NUGGET]
"That’s Floor 8: The Collapsing Void.
The Tower is falling apart up there. The code is unravelling.
Gravity is a suggestion. Time is optional.
That Sigil stabilizes the hole just enough for you to step through without being scattered across the universe."

| Blade holds the Sigil up to the black circle. The void ripples, stabilizing into a swirling vortex of grey and black.

[CHALLENGER]
"It looks like a storm."

[NUGGET]
"It’s worse. It’s nothingness.
The corrupted code, the deleted files, the forgotten memories—they all end up in the drain.
And we're jumping right in.
Hold your breath, Challenger. Reality is about to get very... optional."

| Blade steps into the vortex.
