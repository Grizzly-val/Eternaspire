| Blade stands before the final mechanism in the sky of the Zenith.
| He inserts The Eternaspire key.
| The sky doesn't open. It shatters. The blue dome falls away like broken glass, revealing a dark, cold void filled with floating screens, mana conduits, and the hum of a billion magical calculations.
| A elevator of pure light descends. Blade steps onto it and rises past the sky.

| Floor 11: The Eternaspire.
| The Control Room.
| It doesn't look like a throne room. It looks like a laboratory built by a god. Massive glass tubes pump glowing souls like fuel. Screens display live feeds of the lower floors—the desert, the ice, the void.
| In the center stands... a Blob.
| But not just any blob. This entity is a shifting, swirling mass of fire, ice, lightning, void, and code. It bubbles with the colors of every element Blade has faced.
