| Blade stands before the massive, final gate at the top of the spire. Unlike the others, this gate isn't made of metal or stone. It looks like it's woven from golden light.
| He holds Nugget's Feather. It pulses warmly in his hand, syncing with the hum of the gate.

[CHALLENGER]
"This is it. Floor 10.
The Zenith.
Nugget... you better be on the other side."

| He pushes the feather into the center of the light. The gate dissolves instantly, not with a sound of machinery, but with a soft, welcoming chime.
| A breeze hits his face. It smells of fresh grass, blooming flowers, and clean rain.
| Blade steps through, bracing for a fight.
| Instead, he steps onto a lush, rolling meadow. The ceiling is gone, replaced by a perfect, endless blue sky.

[CHALLENGER]
(Lowering his weapon, confused)
"What... is this?
Grass? Sky?
We're at the top of a cursed tower."

| He looks around. It's paradise. It's everything the Tower isn't. It's too perfect.

[CHALLENGER]


"Nugget has to see this. She'd make some joke about the landscaping budget."

| He turns to share the moment, but the space beside him is empty. The realization hits him harder than any blow from an Echo.

[CHALLENGER]


"Right. She's gone.
Oh yeah... I gotta look for Nugget."

| Blade starts walking through the grass, calling her name. The wind carries his voice away, swallowing it in the unnatural perfection of the Zenith.
