| Blade stands before the gate to the final area of Floor 9: The Fused Dimensions.
| The door is a swirling vortex of colors that shouldn't exist. It hurts to look at.
| He holds the Dimensional Rift Key. The key warps the air around his hand, making his fingers look like they are stretching into infinity.

[CHALLENGER]
"This key... it's bending the light.
If I put this in the lock, I feel like I might turn inside out."

| He pauses, waiting for the quip.
| Silence.
| Nugget is floating a few feet away, her back to him, staring into the abyss of space.

[CHALLENGER]
"Nugget?
Any advice? 'Don't get scrambled'? 'Watch your step'? Nothing?"

| She doesn't even twitch. It’s as if she isn't there.

[CHALLENGER]
(Sighing, a seed of genuine worry planting itself in his chest)
"Alright. I guess I'm talking to myself now.
Here goes nothing."

| Blade inserts the key. The reality around the gate snaps.
| The world fractures like a broken mirror, revealing a path made of mismatched pieces of every floor they have climbed so far.
| Blade steps through. Nugget follows, silent as a shadow.
