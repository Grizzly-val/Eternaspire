| Percival stands over the rapidly decaying body of the Spinefiend. The creature a sentient cactus with a comically large, immaculate mustache dissolves into a puddle of viscous, plant-like sap. |

[NUGGET] "Did you see the look on that thing’s face when you hit it? Pure betrayal! He was trying to look dignified, and you just flattened him."

[PERCIVAL]"It was a cactus with a beard trying to stab me with its spikes. I didn't have time to worry about its dignity. Did it even bleed? That was mostly sap."

| Lying in the puddle of sap is The Golden Ankh. It is crafted from heavy, polished gold and radiates a profound, ancient energy. |

[NUGGET] "The Golden Ankh! Oh, this is the one! This is what that ridiculous remnant was protecting. It screams 'Pharaoh's Vault' doesn't it?"

[PERCIVAL]"An ancient symbol of eternal life. This means we're at the end of the Pyramid. Osarion's Chamber."

[NUGGET] "It grants access to the deepest chambers! Think of all the gold, the power, the really good dried fruit! Now hurry up, I can hear the next wave of mustachioed foliage waddling over here."

| Percival holds the Ankh. The Pyramid walls rumble, and a hidden chamber entrance—perfectly Ankh-shaped—is revealed at the end of the corridor.

[PERCIVAL](Inserting the Ankh into the recess) "This is it."

| The moment the Golden Ankh settles, the air in the Pyramid shimmers. The very structure of the walls stops feeling like stone and starts feeling like bone—ancient, heavy, and final. |

The massive stone slabs of the entrance grind apart, revealing a final, steep ramp leading into a blinding chamber above.

[NUGGET] (Slightly subdued, but quickly recovering) "That's the kind of power that shakes the Tower, Percival. The Pharaoh's Chamber awaits! Go get that final Echo!"

[PERCIVAL] (Stepping onto the ramp, the weight of the Ankh still lingering on his hands) "Let's finish this."
