| Percival stands before the gate to the next floor. The metal isn't rusted or frozen-it's wrong.
| Parts of the gate are pixelated. Others are missing entirely, replaced by floating wireframe meshes.
| Percival holds up The Fractured Key. It vibrates violently, syncing with the instability of the door.

[PERCIVAL]
"The door looks like it's falling apart.
Not breaking... just... failing to exist."

[NUGGET]
"Reality is getting thin, Percival.
The Tower is struggling to keep the simulation running this high up.
Insert the key. But be careful-I don't think the laws of physics apply past this point."

| Percival inserts the glitching key. The world momentarily turns into wireframe and static before snapping back.
| The gate dissolves into a shower of digital artifacts.
| A smell of ozone and rotting meat floods the hallway.

[NUGGET]
(His voice dropping, sounding genuinely disturbed for the first time)
"Oh no.
Not here. Not her."

[PERCIVAL]
"Who?
What is this place?"

[NUGGET]
"Floor 7: The Fragmented Threshold.
It's where the Tower keeps the things it broke but couldn't delete.
Corrupted data. Corrupted souls.
And... her."

| Nugget refuses to elaborate, floating ahead with a grim, uncharacteristic silence.
| Percival steps into the hallway. The floor tiles shift under his feet like loose teeth.
