| Percival stands in a dimly lit corridor of the Pyramid. The walls are covered in identical hieroglyphs that seem to shift when looked at directly.
| He walks forward, but the hallway stretches infinitely. He turns back, and the exit is gone, replaced by the same stretching hallway.

[PERCIVAL]
"We've walked past this same jackal statue three times.
It's a loop. The whole floor is shifting."

[NUGGET]
"It's not shifting, it's lying!
This is the Labyrinth, Percival. It's designed to keep grave robbers walking in circles until they starve.
Good thing we came prepared. Remember that compass we found in the oasis?"

| Percival pulls out the Illusionary Compass. The needle doesn't point north. It spins wildly before snapping to a fixed direction-straight through a solid stone wall.

[PERCIVAL]
"It's pointing at the wall."

[NUGGET]
"Then the wall is a lie!
The Compass points to 'Truth.' If it says go through the wall, you go through the wall.
Trust the tool, not your eyes."

| Percival hesitates, then steps forward, bracing his shoulder. He expects impact, but passes through the stone like it's mist.
| The illusion dissolves, revealing a hidden passage leading deeper into the structure.

[PERCIVAL]
"Walking through walls.
I'm starting to hate this place."

[NUGGET]
"Hate it later. We have a tomb to raid."
