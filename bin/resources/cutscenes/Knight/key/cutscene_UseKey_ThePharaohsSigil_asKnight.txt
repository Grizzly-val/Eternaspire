| Percival stands in the newly-opened area of the Ruined Kingdom of Neferis, before a massive, dark obsidian gate built into the towering stone walls of the city. |

Embedded in the center of the gate is a carving of a great pyramid, with a key slot located exactly where the capstone should be.

| He holds up The Pharaoh's Sigil, a heavy, solid gold relic found inside an ancient statue. It radiates a palpable heat and authority. |

[PERCIVAL] "The Sigil of Osarion. The last key for this floor. It feels like a crown in my hand."

[NUGGET] "Pharaoh Osarion, the Tyrant who ruled over Neferis. He was the one who built that whole blasted city you've been fighting through. That Sigil isn't just a key, Percival. It's his soul's fingerprint."

[PERCIVAL] "He built this? And now his whole kingdom is trapped within this blasted tower."

[NUGGET] "He wished for immortality, Percival. The Tower granted it by freezing his kingdom in time and space, turning his very citizens into remnants, innocents who paid the price for their pharaoh's greed. That Sigil gives you the authority to walk where only he could. The authority to enter his tomb."

| Percival places the heavy Sigil into the capstone slot. It sinks in smoothly and instantly, causing the entire obsidian gate to glow with blinding, molten gold light. |

The light does not dissipate. Instead, it forms a perfect, seamless archway of pure energy, revealing the space beyond.

[PERCIVAL] "It's open. But where does this lead? We're still inside the city."

[NUGGET] "We're inside the city, but we're changing the elevation. Look ahead, Mercenary."

| Through the glowing archway, a spiraling ramp is visible, winding up into the roof of this massive chamber. The ramp is carved into the interior of a huge, impossibly large structure that must be the center of Neferis. |

[PERCIVAL] "A pyramid. In the center of the city. The Pyramid of Osarion."

[NUGGET] "The Pyramid of Osarion. The tyrant's final, desperate resting place. This is where the real heat begins, Percival. Let's see what he left behind."
