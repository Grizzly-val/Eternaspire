| Percival stands before a heavy gate coated in frost, despite the searing heat of the desert behind him.
| He holds the Heart of the Avalanche-a compressed sphere of ice that pulses with a violent, stormy rhythm. It is cold enough to burn his hand.

[PERCIVAL]
"It's freezing.
I can feel a storm raging inside this thing."

[NUGGET]
"That's the Heart of the Avalanche.
Osarion tried to control the weather to preserve his kingdom, but he only managed to bottle a blizzard.
Insert it. But brace yourself-weather in the Tower doesn't 'change,' it crashes."

| Percival pushes the ice sphere into the gate's recess.
| CRACK.
| The sound is deafening, like a mountain snapping in half. The heavy stone doors are blasted inward by a gale-force wind composed entirely of ice shards.
| The heat of Neferis is instantly obliterated, replaced by a blinding white void.

[PERCIVAL]
(Shielding his face, shouting over the wind)
"From an oven into a freezer!"

[NUGGET]
"Welcome to Floor 5: The Glacial Gates!
Keep moving, or your blood will turn to slush!"
