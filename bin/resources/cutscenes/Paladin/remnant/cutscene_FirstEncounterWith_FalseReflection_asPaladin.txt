| Percival walks past a floating shard of mirror-like crystal.
| His reflection in the shard stops walking. It turns to look at him, grinning a smile that is too wide, too sharp.
| It steps out of the crystal. It looks exactly like Percival, but its colors are inverted, and its eyes are hollow.

[PERCIVAL]
"It looks like me. But it stands wrong. Too confident."

[NUGGET]
"False Reflection.
The Stellar Graveyard is full of things that never happened.
That thing is you, if you had no morals. If you enjoyed the killing."

[PERCIVAL]
"It doesn't have my scars. It hasn't earned my face."
