| Aeliana falls, the chains of black light shattering.
| As she hits the ground, the corruption recedes. For a moment, she looks peaceful. The void in her eyes clears, revealing a soft, sad brown.

[AELIANA]
(Whispering)
"I see... him.
He is... waiting by the gate."

| She smiles-a genuine, heartbreaking smile-and dissolves into soft white light.
| However, the light does not ascend. It swirls and is pulled back into the floor, absorbed by the Tower to be recycled later. She is gone, but not free.

[NUGGET]
(Staring at the spot where she vanished, his voice hollow)
"She thinks she found him.
She's just going back into the cycle. The Tower won't let them go.
Why does that make my chest hurt? I don't even have a chest."

[PERCIVAL]
"Maybe you knew them both. In another life.
At least for now... she has peace."

| Percival walks over to the item she left behind. It is a heavy shield-blade, pristine and uncorrupted.

[PERCIVAL]
"Vanguard's Bastion.
It's a weapon made of protection.
She held onto it for him."

[NUGGET]
(Shaking himself, his voice cracking slightly before returning to 'normal')
"Yeah. Well.
Happy endings are rare here. Let's take the win and the loot.
This floor... it feels too personal. I want to leave."
