| Percival drives his weapon through the central eye inside the helmet.
| Malphas shrieks-a sound that shatters the nearby floating rocks-before the massive armor collapses in on itself.
| The crow-like entity dissolves into black feathers that burn away into ash before they touch the ground.

[PERCIVAL]
(Sheathing his weapon, looking expectantly at Nugget)
"Another Echo down.
That one was loud. I think I'm still hearing the ringing."

| Nugget hovers over the pile of ash. She doesn't make a joke. She doesn't cheer. She just stares at the path forward.

[PERCIVAL]
"Nugget?
Usually, this is the part where you insult his fashion sense or tell me I took too long."

| Nugget doesn't respond. She slowly turns and floats toward the exit, her movements stiff, mechanical.

[PERCIVAL]
"Nugget?"

[NUGGET]
(Without looking back)
"...Key. Grab the key.
We're almost there."

| Her voice is flat. Empty.
| Percival watches her go, a frown creasing his brow. The silence feels heavier than the monster's scream.
