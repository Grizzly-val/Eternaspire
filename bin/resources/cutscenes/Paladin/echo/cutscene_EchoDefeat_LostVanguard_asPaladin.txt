| The Lost Vanguard falls to one knee. The massive shield, once held high with immovable strength, slips from its grasp and crashes against the stone with a sound like a tolling bell.
| The blue mist inside the helmet flickers, then fades, revealing nothing but empty darkness within the rusted steel.

[NARRATION]
Long ago, it did not come here to climb. It came here to guard.
The shield it carried was never meant to protect its own heart, but the one beating behind it.

It died holding the line.
In its final moment, before the light left its eyes, it looked back and saw her safe.
It died believing the sacrifice mattered. It died with peace.

The Tower, in its cruelty, preserved that peace.
It trapped the warrior in the eternal instant of that greatest act, forcing it to stand guard over an empty room, waiting for a lover who likely met the same fate as him inside the Eternal Tower.

It is called the Lost Vanguard because it is protecting, but knows not who or what.
The face, the name-all gone. Only the instinct to protect remained, shielding nothing but the empty air behind it.

| The armor crumbles into dust, carried away by a sudden, mournful wind.
| As the chest plate disintegrates, a heavy object detaches from the steel and falls with a dull thud, sliding across the stone to stop at Blade's feet. It is the Ascendant's Token.

[PERCIVAL]
(Sheathing his sword slowly, watching the dust settle)
"It stopped fighting the moment it knew it couldn't win.
It wasn't fear. It was... acceptance."

[NUGGET]
(Quietly)
"Echoes don't die, Percival. They just... fade until the Tower wakes them up again.
But for now, its watch is ended."

| Blade looks down at the token, then back at the empty space where the knight stood.

[PERCIVAL]
"To hold a shield up for that long... without even knowing why anymore.
Is that what happens here? You forget everything except the fight?"

[NUGGET]
"If you're strong enough? Yes.
Weak souls break and become hunger, like the rats. Strong souls... they become habits.
It didn't remember her face, Percival. It just remembered that it wasn't allowed to move."

[PERCIVAL]
"That's worse than dying."

[NUGGET]
"That's the Tower. It preserves your 'greatest' moment until it becomes your cage.
Now, pick up the token. We have a climb to finish, and unlike him, you still know why you're doing it."

[PERCIVAL]
(Picking up the token, his grip tightening)
"Yeah. I do.
Rest well, soldier."
