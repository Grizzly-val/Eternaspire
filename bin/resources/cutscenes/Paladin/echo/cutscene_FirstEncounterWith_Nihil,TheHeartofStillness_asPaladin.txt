| Percival steps into The Throne of Eternal Stillness.
| It is a void. No walls, no ceiling—just an infinite expanse of static and grey noise.
| In the center stands a silhouette. It has no features, no face, no armor. It looks like a hole cut out of reality, filled with static.

[PERCIVAL]
"My eyes... they can't focus on it.
Is that a ghost?"

[NUGGET]
(Hovering behind Percival, his usual blue glow dim and flickering)
"That is Nihil.
He isn't a ghost. He is the absence of one.
He is what happens when an Echo loses its memory, its passion, its name... and just becomes a void."

| Nihil turns. The static intensifies. The sound of the world drops away, leaving a deafening silence.

[PERCIVAL]
"He feels... empty.
Fighting him feels wrong. Like fighting smoke."

[NUGGET]
(Voice hardening, a spark of anger returning)
"He is the end of the road, Percival. The surrender.
He is everything I hate.
He forgot why he climbed. He just stopped.
Wake him up. Or put him down. Just don't let him make us quiet."
