| A small, singular eye forms in the puddle, glaring at Percival. Then, a tentacle of slime pushes the heavy, dripping sack of gold back toward Percival's feet.

[TOWER MASTER]
"Fine. The deal holds. Even if you did wreck the office.
Take the money. It's infinite wealth. It's slimy, yes, but it will buy any ritualist, any resurrection rite, any mage or artifact you need.
Your mother will walk again. You can fund her return to life ten times over."

| Percival freezes.
| For a heartbeat, he doesn't breathe.
| The Tower Master's words hit him like a blade. Not hope - but confirmation.
| The Tower itself couldn't revive her.
| He climbed all this way... and even the godlike mind at the top couldn't undo death.
| His grip trembles. His eyes sting, just for a moment - a crack in an otherwise unbreakable will.
| He thinks of her smile. The one he'll never see again except in memory.
| He thinks of how desperately he had believed the wish would fix everything.
| And how wrong he was.

| He looks at the sack. It's disgusting, covered in rainbow slime, but now it feels heavier than the whole tower.
| He picks it up with a slow, resigned motion.

[PERCIVAL]
(Voice quieter, almost hollow)
"I'll take it.
Money is money. Even if it smells like you."

| It's all he can manage. Anything more and he might break.

[TOWER MASTER]
"Excellent. Transaction complete.
Now, please. Get out of my tower.
I have a lot of cleanup to do, and I really don't want to see your face for another millennium."

| The elevator of light reappears. Percival steps onto it, clutching the sack. Then he stops.

[PERCIVAL]
"One more thing."

[TOWER MASTER]
"What? You have the money! What more do you want?"

[PERCIVAL]
"The Echoes. Aeliana. The Paladin. Nugget.
Let them go.
That wasn't part of the money deal. That's my wish."

[TOWER MASTER]
(The puddle ripples, almost sighing.)
"You greedy little anomaly.
But... since you trashed the containment units anyway... and honestly, I'm tired of their noise in the system...
Fine. System flush initiated.
They're all returning to the cycle. No more loops. Just... peace."

[PERCIVAL]
"Good."

| Percival steps fully onto the elevator. As he descends, he looks back one last time at the grumpy puddle of a god - but his expression is different.
| Tired. Older. Carrying a loss no wish can rewrite.

[PERCIVAL]
(Expressionless while carrying the bag of possibly generational wealth)

[TOWER MASTER]
"Get out!"
