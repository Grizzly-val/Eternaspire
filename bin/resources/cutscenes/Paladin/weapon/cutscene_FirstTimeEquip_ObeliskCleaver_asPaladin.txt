| Percival forces open a sealed sarcophagus in the corner of a collapsed burial chamber.
| Inside, resting on a bed of decayed linen, is a massive battle axe carved from a single piece of black volcanic glass.

[PERCIVAL]
(Lifting the weapon with both hands)
"This isn't a weapon of war.
It's too heavy. Too brutal.
This was made for executions."

[NUGGET]
"That's the Obelisk Cleaver.
The tomb guardians used these to... 'dismiss' anyone who touched the sacred monuments."

| Percival swings the axe. It cleaves the air with a low, terrifying thrum. He brings it down on the stone sarcophagus, shattering the heavy lid into dust with a single blow.

[PERCIVAL]
"It doesn't cut. It obliterates.
It's slow, but if this hits... nothing stands back up."

[NUGGET]
"A brute force solution for a brute force world.
Just don't miss. You won't get a second swing quickly."

[PERCIVAL]
(Strapping the massive axe to his back)
"Then I won't miss."
