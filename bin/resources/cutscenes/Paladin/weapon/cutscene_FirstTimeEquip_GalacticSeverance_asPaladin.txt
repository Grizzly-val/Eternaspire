| Embedded in a meteorite in the center of the graveyard is a sword.
| It pulses with a deep, violet cosmic light. Space seems to bend around its edge.

"Galactic Severance.
It hums with the power of a dying star.
With this... I can cut through anything. Even the final gate."

[NUGGET]
"It’s a weapon made to sever fate itself.
Powerful stuff."

| Percival looks at the blade, seeing his reflection in the cosmic steel. He smiles, a genuine, hopeful look that seems out of place in the void.

[PERCIVAL]
"I can't wait to see Mom alive again.
I miss her so much. I'm going to buy that house by the lake she always wanted. We'll have a garden."

| Nugget flinches. The guilt hits her like a physical blow. She hovers erratically, looking for a distraction.

| He looks at Nugget, trusting her completely.

[PERCIVAL]
"How do you think I should explain her own revival to her? I'll have to worry about that then, hmmmm"

| Nugget looks at him—so full of hope, so willing to sacrifice his own future comfort just to save her.
| And she knows exactly what's going to happen to him.

[NUGGET]

"Yeah. I- I guess you do...
...We should get moving. The Zenith is waiting."
