| Blade exhales deeply, the weight of Nugget’s words and his mother’s condition pressing on him. He glances back toward the small hospital room one last time.
| Inside, his mother looks at him, her eyes filled with worry, as if she can feel the danger her son is about to face.

[BLADE]
"Right… Mom. I’ll… I’ll make this count. I’ll come back with enough."

| He kneels beside the bed, pressing a small pouch of coins into her hand.

[BLADE'S MOM]
"Blade...
You’ve always been my pride… my joy...
Is there really nothing I can do to stop you?"

| Blade can only look at her with eyes that hold no promises of safety, only determination.

[BLADE'S MOM]
"Blade, just-
Just promise me you’ll be careful, okay?"

[BLADE]
"I promise. I’ll come back. I swear it."

| She smiles weakly. He leans down, brushing her hair back gently. The morning sunlight filters through the window, casting long, hopeful shadows across the room.
| Blade rises, slinging his old sword over his shoulder and grabbing his worn leather pack. He takes one last look before stepping outside.
| Nugget flits around impatiently, wings buzzing.

[NUGGET]
"Come on! The Tower won’t wait for anyone’s goodbyes. And I know a mercenary like you isn’t going to sit still anyway."

[BLADE]
(Quietly, under his breath)
"...Ready as I’ll ever be."

| They walk together through the quiet streets. Blade passes by the apothecary, leaving a few coins on the counter to pay for the next treatment. The shopkeeper nods, unaware of the Tower looming on the horizon.
| The Tower rises in the distance, impossibly tall, its faint runes glowing softly as if sensing their approach.
| Nugget flits ahead, a playful gleam in its eyes, but something unreadable flickers in its expression—a hint of knowing too much.

[NUGGET]
"Here we are… the beginning. First step, first floor. Don’t worry, it’s… mostly safe. Mostly."

[BLADE]
(Steadying his grip on his sword)
"Mostly... right. Let’s go."

| The massive gates loom closer, dark and immense, faintly humming in the morning light. Blade and Nugget approach side by side.
| Blade left home with only desperation, a promise, and a sword. Ahead lies the Tower—vast, unknowable, and indifferent. Yet something... somewhere, seems to notice him.
| The two step inside. The doors close behind them with a thunderous echo.
| Darkness. Then, a faint blue glow floods the hall.

[BLADE]
"It’s colder than I thought."

[NUGGET]
"That’s because this place isn’t alive. Not yet.
The Tower watches every new challenger to see if they’re worth waking up for."

[CHALLENGER]
"Great. I get judged by a building now."

[NUGGET]
"Oh, you’ll get used to it. The higher you climb, the more it notices you."

| The floor pulses faintly, lighting a spiral pattern beneath their feet.

[CHALLENGER]
"So this is where I start."

[NUGGET]
"Yup! Floor 0: The Beginning of No End. Kinda poetic, right?"

[CHALLENGER]
"Sounds like misery with extra steps."

| Blade reaches for his pack to check his supplies. His hand grasps nothing but air.
| He spins around, checking his back, his hips. His sword, his armor, his pack—gone. He is standing in his tunic and trousers, completely unarmed.

[CHALLENGER]
"Wait... where are my belongings?!"

[NUGGET]
"The Tower ate them.
The Tower welcomes outsiders because of what they bring into this prison.
That's the nature of Eternaspire. Entry tax."

[CHALLENGER]
"Then how am I supposed to get out of here alive?!
Let me out, now! I made a promise, Nugget!"

[NUGGET]
"Don’t be so dramatic, boy! You’ve got me. You’ll be fine, my hunch has been telling me so.
For now, just use what you have—which is nothing!—and you'll probably survive. The Tower will provide necessities along the way."

| And so, the Mercenary and his cheerful, blue, floating, possibly very manipulative friend step into the great Tower, ready to fight their way to a life of peace, prosperity, and a surprisingly tidy happily-ever-after.
