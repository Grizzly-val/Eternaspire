 Blade enters the center of The Stellar Graveyard.
 The silence here is absolute, until a sound tears through it—the cawing of a thousand crows screaming in unison.
 Descending from a floating debris field is a monstrosity. It is a hulking, humanoid mass of fused armor plates and rotting gray flesh.
 Where a face should be, there is only a dark, hollow helmet. But inside the visor, a massive, singular crow's eye blinks, twitching erratically.

[BLADE]
It looks like a knight that was put through a grinder and reassembled by a bird.

[NUGGET]
That is Malphas, The Distorted Visage.
He builds towers out of corpses. He thinks he's an architect, but he's just a butcher.
Don't let him scream at you, Blade. His voice breaks armor.

 Malphas lands, the impact shaking the floating platform. He spreads four arms—two armored, two skeletal wings.

[MALPHAS]
(Voice overlapping, three different pitches speaking at once)
Building... materials.
Fresh... foundation.
Stay... forever.

[BLADE]
He sees me as a brick.

[NUGGET]
Prove to him you're a wrecking ball.
