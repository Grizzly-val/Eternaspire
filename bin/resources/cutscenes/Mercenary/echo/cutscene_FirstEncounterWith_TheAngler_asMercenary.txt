| Blade walks across a frozen lake of black ice. In the distance, a small, glowing light bobs in the darkness.
| As he approaches, he sees a figure-a woman, weeping, curled into a ball on the ice. She glows with a faint, inviting warmth.

[BLADE]
"Someone's alive here?
She looks... lost."

[NUGGET]
"Don't go near her! That's not a person. That's a lure.
Look down."

| Blade looks at the ice. Beneath the transparent surface, a colossal, shadowy shape is moving. It is the size of a whale, and its mouth is open directly beneath the weeping woman.
| The woman is attached to the beast by a fleshy, bioluminescent stalk.

[NUGGET]
"That is The Angler.
It uses your empathy as bait. It knows you want to save people, so it shows you someone who needs saving.
And when you get close... snap."

| The massive jaws beneath the ice open wider. The "woman" looks up, her face a featureless void, and screams-a sound like grinding glaciers.

[BLADE]
"It's using a puppet made of light.
That's disgusting."

[NUGGET]
"It's efficient.
Break the lure, and the beast will surface. Then you kill the real monster."
