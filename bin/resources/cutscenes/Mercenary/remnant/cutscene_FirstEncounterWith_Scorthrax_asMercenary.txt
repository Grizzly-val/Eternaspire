| The desert air distorts. A heavy thud shakes the ground as a massive shadow rises from behind a dune.

[NUGGET] "Uh... tell me that's just a big rock taking a stretch."

[BLADE] "Rocks don't glow like that."

| Scorthrax steps into view, pincers crackling with heat, its molten tail dripping venom that burns holes into the sand.

[NUGGET] "Aaaaaand the ground is melting. Perfect. Absolutely perfect."

[BLADE] (tightens grip) "That thing isn't here to scare us. It's here to test us."

[NUGGET] "I was hoping for a quiz... maybe a crossword. Not a murder-scorpion."

| Scorthrax raises its tail. The hiss of molten venom fills the air.

[BLADE] "If it wants a fight-
		 -it has one."

( Battle vs. Scorthrax begins.)
