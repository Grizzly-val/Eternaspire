| Resting on a frozen pedestal is a scroll that seems to be vibrating.
| Blade picks it up. The parchment feels like it's made of compressed snow.

[BLADE]
"'Avalanche Strike.'
It doesn't look precise. The diagrams are just... messy lines."

"An avalanche isn't precise. It's inevitable.
You don't aim every snowflake, Blade. You just start the slide and let gravity do the rest.
It's about overwhelming force. Chaos."

| Blade crushes the scroll. White energy rushes up his arm, feeling cold and wild.

[BLADE]
(Flexing his hand)
"I can feel it.
Three strikes. Fast. Reckless.
If the first one misses, the second one buries them."

[NUGGET]
"Exactly. Don't worry about being perfect. just be heavy."
