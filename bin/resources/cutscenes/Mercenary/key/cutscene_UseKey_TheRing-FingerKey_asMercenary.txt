| Blade stands before a door made of seamless blue ice. There is no keyhole, only a handprint indented into the surface.
| The ring finger on the handprint is missing.
| Blade pulls out the Ring-Finger Key-a literal severed finger, frozen solid like stone.

[BLADE]
"A severed finger.
The lock is a hand with a missing digit."

[NUGGET]
"It's a tragic love story! Or a tragic frostbite story.
Someone couldn't let go. So the Tower took the hand, but they kept the finger.
Put it back where it belongs."

| Blade presses the frozen finger into the gap in the ice. It snaps into place with a sickening wet click.
| The ice hand flexes, fingers curling into a fist, and the massive door shatters upward, clearing the way to The Weeping Chasm.

[BLADE]
"It grabbed the wall.
This whole tower is made of body parts and bad memories."

[NUGGET]
"Reduce, reuse, recycle! The Tower wastes nothing."
