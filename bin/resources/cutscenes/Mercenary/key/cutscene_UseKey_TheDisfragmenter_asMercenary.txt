| Blade stands at the precipice of a massive gap in the walkway.
| Floating in the void between two pillars of light are thousands of stone shards—parts of a bridge that shattered long ago.
| He holds up The Disfragmenter. The geometric crystal pulses rapidly, vibrating in his hand as if trying to escape toward the ruin.

[NUGGET]
"Don't drop it! Or... actually, do.
The bridge isn't gone, Blade. It’s just... confused. It forgot how to be a bridge.
That crystal reminds it."

[BLADE]
"Reminds it?
The stone has a memory?"

[NUGGET]
"Everything in the Tower has a memory. That’s why it hurts to be here.
Just toss the crystal into the cloud of debris. It’ll do the rest."

| Blade hesitates, then tosses the shimmering crystal into the floating field of rocks.
| The moment it leaves his hand, it freezes in mid-air. A blinding flash of white light erupts.
| CRACK-SNAP-THUD.
| The sound of stone slamming against stone echoes violently. In seconds, the floating shards rush together, locking into place with unnatural precision, reforming a perfect, pristine bridge.

[BLADE]
(Stepping onto the newly formed surface)
"It didn't just build it. It rewound it.
Like the damage never happened."

[NUGGET]
"Order from chaos.
It’s a beautiful trick, isn't it? Too bad it only works on rocks."

| Blade ignores the comment and walks forward, testing the stone. Solid.
| The path to The Shattered Span is restored.
