| Blade picks up the weapon left behind by Nihil.
| It is the Blade of Entropy. It isn't made of metal; it looks like a shard of the void itself, cut into the shape of a sword.
| Light bends around it, falling into the blade and disappearing.

[BLADE]
"It feels... light. Too light.
Like I'm holding a hole in the world."

[NUGGET]
"That sword doesn't cut flesh; it cuts reality.
It deletes what it touches.
Be careful not to drop it. You might accidentally erase the floor."

| Blade swings it. There is no 'whoosh' sound. Just a silence where the air used to be.

[BLADE]
"Silent. Deadly.
It feels cold in my hand. Like holding a piece of deep space."

[NUGGET]
"It's the ultimate weapon for a place that is falling apart.
Use it well. Or use it to end it all. It's your call."
