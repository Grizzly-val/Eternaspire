| Percival stands at the base of a steep, spiraling incline. The path ahead is shrouded in an unnatural, heavy darkness that his eyes cannot pierce.
| He holds up the Dilapidated Lantern. It is old, rusted, and seemingly broken, but as he approaches the dark stairs, the glass pane begins to vibrate.

[PERCIVAL]
"This lantern... it doesn't have any oil. It doesn't even have a wick.
How is it supposed to light the way?"

[NUGGET]
"It doesn't burn oil, Percival. It burns resonance.
The darkness here isn't an absence of light; it's an overload of memory. Too many echoes screaming at once.
The lantern tunes them out. It cuts a path of silence through the noise."

| Percival raises the lantern. A soft, blue flame ignites inside the rusted casing—not hot, but quiet.
| The darkness ahead recoils as if physically pushed back. The path reveals itself, not just as stone steps, but as floating platforms made of solidified whispers.

[PERCIVAL]
"The light... it makes the world quiet.
I can see the steps now. They look... fragile."

[NUGGET]
"They are made of the last words of people who gave up.
Don't worry, they'll hold your weight. You're too stubborn to fall through a floor made of regrets.
Welcome to The Climb of Echoes. Keep the light steady, or the noise will come back."

| Percival steps onto the first spectral platform. His boot rings out with a clear, solid tone, silencing the whispers beneath his feet.
