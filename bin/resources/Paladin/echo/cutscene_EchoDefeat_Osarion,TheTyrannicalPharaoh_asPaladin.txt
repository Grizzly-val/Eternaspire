| The massive golden armor cracks down the center.
| Osarion tries to stand, reaching out desperately toward the ceiling—toward a sun that isn't there.

[OSARION]
(Voice rasping, fading into a hiss of sand)
"My... pyramid...
Do not... look away...
I am..."

| The gold armor collapses inward, empty. There is no body inside, only a pile of dust and a heavy copper key. The "immortal" Pharaoh was nothing but air and arrogance held together by a curse.

[PERCIVAL]
(Sheathing his weapon)
"He crumbled. There was nothing inside the armor."

[NUGGET]
"Of course not. He gave up his humanity for 'eternity.'
The Tower took his soul and left the costume."

| Nugget floats over the pile of gold scrap. He doesn't look sad; he looks satisfied, almost vindictive.

[NUGGET]
"He thought he could outsmart the Tower. He thought if he built walls thick enough, death couldn't get in.
But the Tower loves tyrants, Percival. They make such obedient prisoners because they refuse to leave their cages."

[PERCIVAL]
"You sound glad he's gone."

[NUGGET]
"He was a waste of magic. He sacrificed everyone else just to save himself.
If you're going to defy death, you do it for love, not for a shiny chair."

| Percival picks up the Pyramid Keystone from the throne.

[PERCIVAL]
"For love...
Is that why you're here, Nugget?"

[NUGGET]
(Freezing for a split second, then spinning around cheerfully)
"I'm here for the entertainment! And right now, the show is moving to Floor 5!
Grab the key! It’s getting stuffy in here!"
