| Percival enters The Festering Core. The room is a nightmare of fleshy walls pulsing with neon circuits.
| In the center, suspended by chains made of black light, is a woman.
| She wears armor that matches the Lost Vanguard's style, but it is shattered. Her skin is grey, and she weeps tears of pure void that eat through the floor.

[PERCIVAL]
"She... she looks human.
Or she was."

[NUGGET]
(Freezing in mid-air. His voice is barely a whisper.)
"Aeliana..."

[PERCIVAL]
"You know her?"

[NUGGET]
"I... I don't know. The name just... fell out of me.
She feels familiar. Like a song I forgot the words to."

| Percival shifts his stance, raising his weapon into a high, aggressive guard—the opening stance of Rending Cut.
| It is the same stance the Lost Vanguard used.

| Aeliana raises her head. Her eyes are empty holes. She doesn't see Percival; she looks through him, searching for someone who isn't there.

[AELIANA, THE VOIDBOUND]
(Voice echoing from everywhere at once)
"He... promised.
Where... is... the shield?"

| Aeliana's empty eyes widen. For a split second, the void recedes.

[AELIANA, THE VOIDBOUND]
"That... stance...
Is... he... safe?"

[NUGGET]
(Trembling)
