| Percival enters the final arena of The Fused Dimensions.  | Reality here is a chaotic swirl of every previous floor—sand mixing with ice, clockwork gears grinding against fleshy walls. 


| Standing in the center is a warrior. He wears armor that is battered, broken, and scorched, but the silhouette is undeniably familiar.  | He holds a sword that looks like a shattered version of the Galactic Severance. 


[PERCIVAL] "Hey Nugget, that looks like an Echo. Should I make my move?" 

| Nugget does not float forward. | She freezes, her wings locking up. Her voice shrinks into a high-pitched shriek of genuine terror. 

[NUGGET] "It's that same feeling..." 

[PERCIVAL] "Finally, you've responded. What feeling?" 

[NUGGET] "Percival, be sure to defeat that. That's the Banished Knight." 

[PERCIVAL] "Y-yeah, of course? That's what we've been doing right? We knock them down, we move up." 

[NUGGET] "Yeah, you're right. And you'll go to the tenth floor." 

[PERCIVAL] "Ye-Yeah? And I will wish for my mother's revival, right? That's the deal." 

| Guilt rushes into Nugget again, then turns to him. Her blue light is trembling violently. 

[NUGGET] "Y-yeah... you should be smarter, Percival." 

[PERCIVAL] "Hey! That's an insult. I've gotten us this far." 

[NUGGET] "Yeah, because you are stupid... An idiot... A fool." 

[PERCIVAL] "W—" 

| Before Percival can finish, the Banished Knight snaps his head up. He sees Nugget.  | A roar of pure, unfiltered hatred erupts from the helmet.  | The Knight moves faster than any Echo before him. | He ignores Percival entirely, blurring into a streak of steel aimed directly at the floating companion. 



[BANISHED KNIGHT] "DECEIVED!" 

| CRASH.  | The impact sends shockwaves through the reality-warped floor. Percival is blown back by the wind pressure. 

| When the dust clears, the Knight is standing where Nugget was.  | Nugget is gone. | On the far right of the arena, a pile of debris shifts, but there is no sign of the blue light. 


[PERCIVAL] "Nugget!" 

| Percival turns back to the Knight, his grip tightening on the Galactic Severance until his knuckles turn white. 

[PERCIVAL] "You... you cheap-shotting armor pile. She’s just a guide!" 

| The Knight turns slowly to Percival. He doesn't attack immediately.  | He looks at Percival with a confusing mixture of rage and pity. 

[BANISHED KNIGHT] (Voice raspy, sounding like a man who hasn't spoken in eons) "Mother... Upset... Nugget... Forgive... Friend..." 

[PERCIVAL] "The guy below spouted the same stuff. Two floors in a row of Echoes that resemble me... Except this time, I'm really, really pissed off!" 

| Percival charges, the cosmic energy of his sword flaring violently.
