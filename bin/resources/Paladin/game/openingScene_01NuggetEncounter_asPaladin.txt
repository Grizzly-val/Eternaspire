| Percival wipes mud from his face. Floating in front of him is a small, glowing sphere with wings.

[PERCIVAL]
"A spirit?
Have you come to mock me too? Or are you a demon sent to tempt me?"

[NUGGET]
"Demon? Spirit? Nah, I'm Nugget.
And wow, that was intense. 'Burn the heretic!' Very old school.
So... trying to revive the dead? Bold move. Usually gets you fired."

[PERCIVAL]
(Staring at the burning chapel in the distance)
"They destroyed it. The equations. The reagents.
I had solved the mortality paradox. I just needed... power."

[NUGGET]
"You needed a miracle.
And let's be honest, your Church isn't in the business of granting those. They just sell the idea of them."

[PERCIVAL]
"She was everything to me. I cannot accept that she is just... gone.
Physics says energy cannot be destroyed. Souls are energy. They have to be somewhere."

[NUGGET]
"Spoken like a true nerd! I like you.
You're right, you know. Souls don't disappear. Sometimes... they just get trapped. Or stored."

| Nugget floats closer, lowering his voice conspiratorially.

[NUGGET]
"If you want to defy the Natural Order... you need to go somewhere that doesn't follow the rules.
Somewhere where 'impossible' is just a suggestion."

[PERCIVAL]
"The Eternaspire."

[NUGGET]
"Bingo.
The Tower holds the keys to reality. Life, death, time... it's all just code in there.
If you climb to the top... the Master can rewrite the file."

[PERCIVAL]
(Slowly standing up, the mud dripping from his ruined robes)
"Rewrite the file...
Revive her."

[NUGGET]
"Exactly. No church guards. No burning books. Just you, the Tower, and a lot of things trying to kill you.
But hey, for a guy who committed a taboo, a little danger is nothing, right?"

[PERCIVAL]
"I will storm the gates of hell if I have to.
Lead the way, spirit."
