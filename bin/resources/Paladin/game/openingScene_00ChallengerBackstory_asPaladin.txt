| Before there were stories, there was a fracture.
| No one agrees—only that something tore the sky from its reflection.
| From that wound rose a structure no one remembers building.
| It calls to those who have peered into the abyss and begged it to blink.

| ...

| The scene is a hidden, underground laboratory beneath a chapel. The air is thick with smoke and the smell of burning paper.
| A man in priestly robes—Percival—is frantically trying to gather scattered notes from the floor. His hands are stained with ink and ash.
| Above, heavy boots stomp on the floorboards. The door bursts open.

[CHURCH ENFORCER]
"Heretic! Seize him!"

| Soldiers in white and gold armor pour into the room. They start smashing vials, tearing books, and setting fire to the research notes.

[PERCIVAL]
"No! Stop!
You don't understand! I was so close!
The formula... the soul tether... I just needed one more catalyst!"

[HIGH PRIEST]
(Stepping into the room, looking at Percival with disgust)
"You dare try to play God?
The dead are gone, brother. To call them back is a sin against the Natural Order.
Your mother rests in the light. Leave her there!"

[PERCIVAL]
(Struggling against the guards holding him)
"She doesn't rest! She was taken too soon! It was a sickness, a mistake!
I can fix it! I can bring her back!"

[HIGH PRIEST]
"You are mad with grief.
Burn it all. Leave nothing of this blasphemy."

| Percival watches helplessly as his life's work—years of alchemy, theology, and forbidden magic—turns to ash in seconds.
| The portrait of his mother on the desk curls and blackens in the flames.

[PERCIVAL]
"Don't... please...
It was all for her..."

| The Priest leans down.
"You are exiled. If you ever return to the Holy City, you will be executed.
Go. And pray for forgiveness."

| The guards throw him out into the rain and mud. The door to his sanctuary is barred.
| He lies in the mud, staring at the locked door.

[PERCIVAL]
"Forgiveness?
I don't want forgiveness. I want results."

| THUD.
| Something small and hard hits him in the head.
| "Ow! Watch where you're lying down! Mud is terrible for my complexion!"
