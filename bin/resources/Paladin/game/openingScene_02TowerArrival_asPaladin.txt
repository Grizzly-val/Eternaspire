| The rain has stopped, but the sky remains grey.
| Percival stands before the Tower. He clutches a heavy book—the only journal he managed to hide in his robes—and a simple mace.

[PERCIVAL]
"It radiates energy.
Necrotic... divine... elemental... it's a chaos of wavelengths."

[NUGGET]
"It's a soup! A delicious soul soup.
Ready to jump in?"

[PERCIVAL]
"I have nothing left to lose. My title is gone. My home is ash.
This Tower is my only laboratory now."

| The massive gates open with a sound like a tomb unsealing.
| They enter. The darkness swallows them.
| Floor 0 lights up with a cold, blue hum.

[PERCIVAL]
"Fascinating. The ambient mana density here is suffocating.
I need to take notes..."

| He reaches for his hidden journal. It's gone.
| He reaches for his mace. Gone.
| His robes are replaced by simple, rough cloth.

[PERCIVAL]
"What? My journal! My calculations!
Where are they?!"

[NUGGET]
"Consumed!
The Tower doesn't like outside research. It prefers you to learn the hard way.
Consider it a clean slate. No notes. No bias."

[PERCIVAL]
"That journal contained the memory of her voice!
You... this place is a thief!"

[NUGGET]
"It's a prison, doc. Thieves are the least of your worries.
You wanted to defy death?
Well, start by not dying here. You have no weapon, no spells, and no notes.
Just your faith. Let's see if it holds up."

[PERCIVAL]
(Clenching his empty fists, his eyes burning with fanatical resolve)
"My faith was burned.
All I have left is my will. And that will be enough."
