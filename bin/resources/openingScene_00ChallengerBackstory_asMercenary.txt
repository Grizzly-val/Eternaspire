The rain falls heavy over cracked rooftops. A city asleep in hunger. In a small room, a man sits beside a frail woman covered in thin sheets.

MOTHER: (weak smile) You shouldn’t be out there this late again… the guild won’t pay you more just for working yourself to death.

A cough wracks her body. He holds her hand, trembling.

CHALLENGER: (quietly) I’ll find a way. I promise.

Voices echo faintly — whispers about a “tower that grants what one desires, if they survive its climb.”

CHALLENGER (narrating): They said the tower gives you what you’ve earned. Power. Wealth. Even salvation. I didn’t believe them—

He looks at his coin pouch. Empty.

CHALLENGER: —until I had nothing left to lose.
