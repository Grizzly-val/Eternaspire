  "-lade...?
  Blade!
  BLADE!!

  Tsk! You sure are enjoying the sleep of your life, huh?
  Wait? Are those tears?
  Are you crying? Haha! Crying in your sleep, what are you? A kid?
  Let me guess, is it about your mom? *sigh You poor kid.
  Like what I always tell you, 
  just keep doing a good job with the requests thrown at us and you'll eventually be able to afford your mom's treatment.
  That is if you don't die, hahaha!"

| Challenger	: Blade
| Age		: 21
| Job		: Mercenary


| At the hospital

[Blade]
  "One more contract… and maybe, just maybe, I'll be able to afford her medicine.
  | A soft cough echoes from the room to the hallway. He heads toward his mother’s room door, pale in the candlelight.
  Mom!"

[Blade's Mom]
  "I got you! I knew coughing loud would get you to come here.
  Hehe! I'm sorry, Blade. I had to resort to that method 'cause I missed my Blade so much."

[Blade]
  "Mom, this is no time to be joking!
  .
  Blood's coming out of your mouth,
  you cough out blood almost every day, mom.
  How can you be so relaxed?!"

[Blade's Mom]
  "Did you not learn from your dad?
  He may not be here with us now, but I'm a firm believer of your Dad's way of life.
  I firmly believe that 'If the Reaper is coming for the bill, I won't pay in silence.' 
  I'm just laughing my way to the grave, son, that way, im also running away from it. Smart, aren't I?"

[Blade]
  "Don't joke about that! Just stop talking and just rest, mom."

| Silence filled the room

[Blade's Mom]
  "I'm already filled with plenty of happines, Blade.
  I had such a loving husband,
  I lived in a warm home, comfortable,
  and now, I get to see my son deeply express his love towards me
  and care for me almost everyday.
  .
  Except for the days you're out on your job.
  .
  Blade,
  did you think I wouldn't notice?
  .
  You can forget about me, Blade!
  You are capable of so much more!
  Go live your life!
  .
  .
  *sobs
  Go quit that job, Blade. Mom's begging you.
  Cut ties with those-
  those dangerous bunch!
  Don't throw your life away for me,
  just let me die peacefully with no regret, Blade!"

[Blade]
  "How could I possibly do that?!"

*SLAM!
"OWIEE!"

| Amidst the heated mother and son argument, something came flying from afar slamming onto the hospital window.

| The argument was interrupted and they both wiped their tears

[Blade] 
  "I'll go check"
