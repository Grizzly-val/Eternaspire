CHALLENGER (clutches chest) It’s not pain… it’s something deeper.
NUGGET (hovering nervously) Uh, you’re glowing in a bad way. Or a good way Hard to tell!
CHALLENGER (breathing slow) …It’s not the Tower this time. It’s me.
NUGGET (pauses) You sure
For a moment, Nugget’s voice loses its usual bounce. The air around them feels heavier.
CHALLENGER (rises, steady) Maybe that’s all I needed—to start pushing back.
Golden sparks flicker in the dust. The Tower hums faintly in reply.
NUGGET (forced laugh) Hah! Guess it’s jealous. Happens sometimes when someone breaks the rules.
CHALLENGER Rules You mean whatever this thing decides for me
NUGGET (quickly) Nope! Nope, no rules here—just climbin’ and winnin’!
Nugget spins in a circle, tone returning to normal, but avoids eye contact.
CHALLENGER (grips weapon) Then I’ll keep climbing. Let’s see how far this will goes.
NUGGET (quietly, almost to themself) …Yeah. Let’s see.
