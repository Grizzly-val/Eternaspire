NUGGET: Huh. The Tower’s gettin’ fancy with its keys now.

CHALLENGER: (watching the sparks) No… it’s testing my hands. A whetstone for a dull blade.

NUGGET: (grins uneasily) Don’t start thinkin’ it cares. This place doesn’t hand out upgrades—it grinds ‘em out of you.

CHALLENGER: Then let it grind. I can take the heat.

The door shudders, groaning open as the key disintegrates into fine, glowing dust.

NUGGET: (voice drops a note) You’re changin’, y’know. The Tower’s supposed to change you, not the other way around.

CHALLENGER: (steps through the threshold) Maybe it’s about time someone does.

Nugget floats after him, hesitating for a fraction of a second.

NUGGET: (softly) …Just be careful what gets sharpened, Challenger. Some edges cut both ways.
