[BLADE] 
  "What… what are you?"

[NUGGET] 
  "Oh! You noticed me! 
  Huh...
  I guess introductions are in order. 
  Name's… Nugget. But don't worry about that."

[BLADE]
  .
  .
  That’s not exactly helpful.

[NUGGET]
  "Eh, names are overrated anyway. 
  Important thing is... you seem busy. Or... troubled?"

[BLADE] 
  "It's none of your concern."

| Nugget tilts its head, small wings fluttering, as if thinking.

[NUGGET] 
  "Hmm… that’s rough. Sounds like... you need a big win. 
  Something that could... change things, dramatically. 
  But hey, that's just my unsolicited thought."

[BLADE]
  .
  .
  "And you are?"

[NUGGET] 
  "That's not important. Really. Just… someone who notices things. Helps... nudge sometimes.
  Suggests life-changing advices
  about fame,
  status,
  money
  miracles... *side-eye"

| Blade hesitates, observing Nugget, unsure whether to trust it.

[NUGGET]
  "If you wanted... a way to really make a difference, maybe there’s a path. But… whatever. Ignore me."

[BLADE] 
  "...

  .
  What is it?"

[NUGGET] 
  "Excellent! That’s settled then.
  Oh… by the way, 
  I might tag along. 
  Nothing creepy. Promise."

[BLADE] 
  "Hey! I haven't agreed yet."

[NUGGET] 
  "I only needed your interest.
  Plus, A mercenary like you would definitely like this.
  About how I know about your profession,

  .

  Come on! Kiss your mother goodbye, 
  make-up with her,
  and follow me!"
