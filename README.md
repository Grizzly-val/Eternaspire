Players choose an avatar and ascend a mysterious tower said to grant any wish to those who conquer it. Whether seeking wealth, power, or knowledge, the only limit is the challenger’s imagination. 

As players climb the tower, they uncover fragments of its secrets and the stories of daring challengers who came before. The game combines strategic turn-based combat with exploration and storytelling, all through a simple console interface.
