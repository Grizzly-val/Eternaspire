## From Master

> 11-11-2025 : Blueprints for the game are basically finished.
> We just need to do few optimizations and layout the story of the game before we declare the game finished
> Great gaps between pushes because hehe. Master played with git commands and corrupted the projects, good thing master had a local backup.
