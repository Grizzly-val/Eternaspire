| Percival hefts the weapon left behind by the Paladin.
| It is the Corrupted Redeemer. A massive mace that feels like it weighs as much as a mountain.
| When he holds it, he doesn't feel power. He feels a crushing, suffocating anxiety.

[PERCIVAL]
"It’s heavy.
It feels like... waiting for someone's recognition.
It feels like holding a bill you can't pay. Like praying and getting no answer."

| Percival swings it. The air groans around the head of the mace. It moves with a desperate, frantic momentum.

[PERCIVAL]
"It hits with the force of a falling star.
If I use this... I have to be sure I'm right.
Because he thought he was right, and look where he ended up."

[NUGGET]
"Just don't let it weigh you down, Mercenary. Hold the weapon. Don't carry the burden."
