| Percival steps into a wide, circular chamber. The walls are covered in thousands of frantic scratches—maps carved over maps, rendering the stone illegible.
| In the center, a figure in tattered leathers paces in a perfect, endless circle.
| It holds a lantern that sheds no light and a walking stick worn down to a splinter.
| It does not speak. It only makes a low, rasping sound—like wind blowing through a crack in a tomb.

[PERCIVAL]
"Another Echo.
It's just... walking. Around and around."

[NUGGET]
(Watching the figure with a cold, almost pitying intensity)
"That’s the Unmoving Nomad.
Look at the floor, Percival. He’s worn a groove into the rock.
He’s been walking that same circle for centuries."

| The Nomad stops abruptly. It holds the dead lantern up to a blank wall, shaking it violently, as if trying to force light to appear. When none comes, it scratches the wall frantically with its free hand, adding to the mess of maps.

[PERCIVAL]
"What is it doing? Searching?"

| The Nomad slowly turns its head. Under the wide-brimmed hat, there is no face—only a swirling void of blue dust.
| It senses Percival’s movement—a traveler who is actually moving.
| The Nomad lets out a shriek—a sound of pure, jealous frustration—and slams its staff into the ground, blocking the way forward.

[PERCIVAL]
(Drawing his weapon)
"It doesn't like that I'm not stuck like him."

[NUGGET]
"He hates it.
Show him what a real journey looks like."
