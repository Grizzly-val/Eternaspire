| Blade lands the final blow. There is no impact sound—only a distortion, like a bad signal on a screen.
| Nihil’s form flickers violently. For a second, the static clears, revealing the faint, weeping outline of a man... before it dissolves entirely into nothingness.

[BLADE]
"He didn't scream. He didn't fight back at the end.
He just... ceased."

[NUGGET]
"He was already gone a long time ago. You just deleted the file."

| Where Nihil stood, a jagged shard of darkness remains. It seems to suck the light out of the room.
| Beside it lies a strange, vibrating key that seems to flicker in and out of vision.

[BLADE]
(Picking up the sword)
"Blade of Entropy.
It feels like holding a black hole."

| He reaches for the key next. It stings his hand, like static electricity.

[BLADE]
"And this key... The Fractured Key.
It’s glitching. I can see my hand through it."

[NUGGET]
(Staring at the empty spot where Nihil was)
"Total erasure.
That’s the danger of this place. If you lose your drive... you don't just die. You fade.
You become background noise."

[BLADE]
(Sheathing the void blade)
"You okay, Nugget? You've been weird since we entered this floor."

[NUGGET] (Shaking his head, forcing a bright, slightly manic smile) "Me? I'm fantastic! Just contemplating the terrifying fragility of existence! Standard Tuesday stuff! Now come on, grab that key and lezgoo upward conquer this filthy eternally spiraling upwards baby tower!"

[BLADE] “Key? Oh, didn’t see tha- wait… What do you mean by baby tower?"

[NUGGET] "LET’S GO!! YIPPIE"

[BLADE] "HEY! NUGGET!
.
YOU BIRD!"
