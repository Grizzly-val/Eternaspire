| Blade steps off the restored bridge onto a wide, circular platform.
| The air here is different—heavier. It smells not of rot or ozone, but of old iron and dried blood.
| In the center of the platform stands a figure. It is humanoid, clad in armor that looks centuries old, cracked and fused with the stone beneath it.
| It holds a massive, fractured shield, its head bowed in eternal vigil.

[BLADE]
(Stopping abruptly)
"That’s not a monster. That’s... a person.
Is he alive?"

[NUGGET]
(Voice dropping to a rare, serious whisper)
"No. Not anymore.
But he hasn't left, either."

| The figure slowly raises its head. Its helmet is empty, filled only with a swirling, sorrowful blue mist. It hefts the massive shield with a groan of grinding metal.

[BLADE]
"It feels different from the rats. The Gnawers just wanted to eat.
This thing... it feels like it's waiting."

[NUGGET]
"You've got a sharp soul, Blade.
See, the Gnawers, the Blobs? They are Remnants.
Think of them like... bugs in a jar. The Tower catches small, simple souls—animals, pests, confused spirits—and mashes them together until they're just hunger with legs.
The Tower keeps them like a child hoarding pets."

| The armored figure slams its shield into the ground. A shockwave of blue energy ripples across the floor, shaking the platform.

[NUGGET]
"But this... this is an Echo.
The Tower doesn't just collect bugs. It collects legends.
Generals, kings, heroes... people with souls so heavy with passion and will that the Tower couldn't crush them."

[BLADE]
(Drawing his sword, feeling the weight of the air pressing down on him)
"So it imprisoned them instead."

[NUGGET]
"Exactly. It traps them, stripping away their names but keeping their burning desire to fight.
That is the Lost Vanguard. He was probably a protector once. A shield for his people.
Now? He's just a wall that the Tower put in your way."

| The Lost Vanguard raises a rusted blade, pointing it silently at Blade. It is a challenge, not an instinct.

[BLADE]
"He’s not hunting. He’s dueling.
...Fine.
If he wants to hold the line, I’ll have to break it."

[NUGGET]
"Careful, Blade. Remnants fight to feed.
Echoes fight because they don't know how to stop."
