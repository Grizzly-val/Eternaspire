| Blade enters the final chamber of the glacier. The air is so cold it burns the lungs.
| Floating in the center of the room is a massive, terrifying entity. It is a colossal human torso, severed at the waist, fused into a floating throne of jagged black ice.
| Its eyes are hollow pits weeping liquid nitrogen. In its hands, it holds a massive, needle-like lance.

[NUGGET]
(Voice trembling, his glow dimming in the cold)
"That... is Vorthos, The Curator.
He doesn't just kill you. He pauses you.
He collects moments of perfect stillness. He wants to turn us into statues for his gallery."

[VORTHOS]
(His voice sounds like a glacier calving—slow, booming, and impossibly deep)
"Why... do... you... move?
Motion... is... chaos.
Be... still."

| Vorthos raises the massive needle. The air around it crystallizes.

[BLADE]
"He’s slow.
But we have to be careful."

[NUGGET]
"He’s already dead, Blade. He just hasn't shattered yet.
Break him before he adds us to the shelf!"
