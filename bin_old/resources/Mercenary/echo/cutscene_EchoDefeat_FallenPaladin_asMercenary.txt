| The Fallen Paladin drops to one knee. His massive mace slips from his fingers, crashing through the floor of the Nexus and tumbling into the infinite void below.
| The black corruption fusing his armor begins to flake away, revealing the gleaming silver of a holy knight underneath for just a moment.
| He reaches out, his hand trembling, not towards Blade, but towards Nugget.

[FALLEN PALADIN]
(Voice clear, sounding young and terrified)
"Guide...
Did I... do it?
Is she... awake?"

| Blade stiffens. The question hits him harder than any physical blow. It is the exact same question he asks himself every night.

[BLADE]
"He's asking about his mom.
Even at the end... he's just a son."

| Nugget flies close to him. She places her tiny hands on his helmet. Tears stream down her face, though her expression is one of utter confusion. She answers him on instinct, not logic.

[NUGGET]
"Yes. Yes, Paladin.
She's awake. She's safe. You saved her."

[FALLEN PALADIN]
(A sigh of infinite relief)
"Good...
The taboo... was worth it.
Tell her... I wasn't... afraid."

| The Paladin bows his head and dissolves into soft, golden particles. The light is warm, contrasting the cold void of the floor.
| Nugget hovers there, staring at the empty space where her failed hero stood. She touches her own face, surprised to find it wet.

[NUGGET]
"He never found the answer. I had to lie to him.
...Why did I do that? I don't even know him."

[BLADE]"You guided him too? Don’t we two share a lot in common? I’d basically be him if I had chosen a god instead of a sword."

[NUGGET] (Voice hollow, trembling with an emotion she can't name) "I... I don't know. Why does it feel like I've stood here a thousand times before? I don’t even know who I am at this point, why am I feeling extreme guilt."

| She wipes her face aggressively, trying to scrub away the confusion.

[NUGGET]
"The Tower doesn't give miracles. It just gives you a place to die trying.
Let's go. Before I start feeling things I'm not supposed to feel."
