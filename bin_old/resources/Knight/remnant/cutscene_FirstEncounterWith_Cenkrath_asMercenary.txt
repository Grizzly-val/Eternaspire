[PERCIVAL] (steps forward) "It’s a crawler. Desert hunter."

[NUGGET] "Hunter? No, nonono—bury it back underground!"

[PERCIVAL] "It’s reading us. Deciding which one to strike first."

[NUGGET] Pick him! Pick him! He looks way tastier!

Cenkrath snaps forward, sand spraying everywhere.

[PERCIVAL] "Too late—
It chose both of us."
