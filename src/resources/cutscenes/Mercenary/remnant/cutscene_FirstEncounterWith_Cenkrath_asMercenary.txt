[NUGGET] "AAAA- WHY DOES IT HAVE SO MANY LEGS?!"

[BLADE] (steps forward) "It's a crawler. Desert hunter."

[NUGGET] "Hunter? No, nonono-bury it back underground!"

| Cenkrath lowers its head, antennae twitching, sensing vibrations.

[BLADE] "It's reading us. Deciding which one to strike first."

[NUGGET] Pick him! Pick him! He looks way tastier!

Cenkrath snaps forward, sand spraying everywhere.

[BLADE] "Too late-
		It chose both of us."


( Battle vs. Cenkrath begins.)
