| The hallway ahead is blocked by a strange, shimmering distortion.
| The floor tiles ripple like disturbed water, and a shape bulges upward—translucent, wobbling, and pulsing with faint, erratic arcs of lightning.
| It lets out a sound that resembles a wet sneeze.

[BLADE]
(Reaching instinctively for his hip)
"What in the hells is that?
It looks like a storm cloud drowned in a puddle."

[NUGGET]
"Eww! It’s jiggly!
That, my friend, is an Elemental Blob.
Think of it as the Tower's way of saying 'Hello!'... with voltage."

[BLADE]
"Great. A sentient lightning hazard."
(His hand grasps at empty air where his sword used to be)
"Damn it. I keep forgetting.
The Tower ate my sword."

[NUGGET]
"Oh, right! The entry tax.
Well, this is awkward. You're trying to fight a monster, and you're dressed for a casual walk."

[BLADE]
(Stepping back as the blob lurches forward, crackling menacingly)
"Nugget, I have no weapon.
You want me to punch the electrified jelly? That sounds like a suicide method, not a strategy."

[NUGGET]
"Don't be so dramatic! It's just a little electrified.
Besides, look at it! It has no bones! It barely has a brain!
Just... I don't know, dodge! Bob and weave!
Use those mercenary instincts you brag about!"

| The Blob hisses, expanding suddenly as it prepares to lunge.

[BLADE]
(Raising his fists, looking ridiculous and knowing it)
"I am going to die on the ground floor fighting a angry dessert.
Mom would be so proud."

[NUGGET]
"That’s the spirit!
Go get 'em, tiger! Or... go get 'em, punching bag!
I'll be over here, providing moral support from a safe distance."

| Blade gritted his teeth. He had no steel, but he had desperation. And right now, that would have to be enough.
