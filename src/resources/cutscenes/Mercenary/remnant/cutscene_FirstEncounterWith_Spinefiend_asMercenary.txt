| A soft rustle echoes from behind a cluster of cracked stones. A single cactus wiggles... dramatically.

[NUGGET] "...Is that cactus moving?"

[BLADE] No. It's posing.

| The cactus slowly turns. A long luxurious mustache curls into view. Two glowing eyes open beneath it.

[NUGGET] "Oh no. Oh NO. It's alive AND fabulous."

[BLADE] (backs up) "Why does it look like it's judging me?"

[NUGGET] "Maybe because you don't have a mustache that amazing."

| Spinefiend "straightens up, spines rattling like bones clicking together. Its mustache twitches with pride."
[BLADE] "That's not just decoration..."
[NUGGET] "Look out-its eyebrows are made of needles!"

| The creature steps forward, leaving tiny circular holes in the sand with each movement.

[BLADE] "Ready?"

[NUGGET] "I was born ready. I mean-no, that's a lie. But let's go anyway!"

( Battle vs. Spinefiend begins.)
