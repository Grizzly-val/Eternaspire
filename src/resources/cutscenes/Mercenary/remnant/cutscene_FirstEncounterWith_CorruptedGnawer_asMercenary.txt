| Blade steps into a hallway that flickers. One moment it's stone, the next it's raw meat, the next it's wireframe.
| A creature scuttles out from a hole in the texture of the wall.
| It looks like the Gnawer from Floor 1, but wrong. Its texture is stretched, its limbs are floating detached from its body, and it emits a sound like a skipping audio file.

[BLADE]
"It's a Gnawer. But it looks... broken."

[NUGGET]
(Wincing as the creature screeches)
"That's a Corrupted Gnawer.
The Tower tried to load a rat, but the file was corrupted.
It's in constant pain because its biology doesn't match the physics engine anymore."

[BLADE]are you saying? Piology? Bhysics?"

| The creature snaps its jaw, and the sound arrives a second later.

[BLADE]
"This feels sickening."

[NUGGET]
"Put it out of its misery. It's a mercy kill."
