| Embedded in a meteorite in the center of the graveyard is a sword.
| It pulses with a deep, violet cosmic light. Space seems to bend around its edge.
| Blade pulls it free. It feels like he is holding a constellation.

[BLADE] 
"Galactic Severance.
It hums with the power of a dying star.
With this... I can cut through anything. Even the final gate."

[NUGGET]
"It's a weapon made to sever fate itself.
Powerful stuff."

| Blade looks at the blade, seeing his reflection in the cosmic steel. He smiles, a genuine, hopeful look that seems out of place in the void.

[BLADE] 
"I can't wait to see Mom lively again.
Not just cured... but happy. I'm going to buy that house by the lake she always wanted. We'll have a garden."

| Nugget flinches. The guilt hits her like a physical blow. She hovers erratically, looking for a distraction.

[NUGGET]
"Why... uh...
Why don't you just wish for your mother's health? Keep it simple, right? Less room for the Tower to monkey's paw you?"

[BLADE] 
(Pausing, considering it)
"Oh yeah... I could do that.
I was too blinded by wanting to also give her a good life after being cured. I wanted everything."

| He looks at Nugget, trusting her completely.

[BLADE] 
"You think I should just secure her health? Yeah... I think I should.
As long as she's alive, I can work for the rest. I can handle the mercenary work if she's safe."

| Nugget looks at him-so full of hope, so willing to sacrifice his own future comfort just to save her.
| And she knows exactly what's going to happen to him.

[NUGGET]
(Voice cracking, forced cheerfulness sounding brittle)
"Yeah. Health is... health is the most important thing.
Smart choice, Blade.
...We should get moving. The Zenith is waiting."
