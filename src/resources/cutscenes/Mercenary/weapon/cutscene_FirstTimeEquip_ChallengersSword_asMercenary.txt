| The smell of ozone mixes with the stench of decay.
| Blade kicks aside a pile of rusted scrap and debris—remnants of previous failures accumulated on Floor 0.
| Amidst the garbage rubble, half-buried under twisted metal, a dull blade glints.

[BLADE]
(Staring at the trash heap)
"This is it?
My great weapon is a piece of junk someone else threw away?"

[NUGGET]
"One man's trash is another man's... survival.
Besides, look closer. It’s not rusting like the others.
The Tower doesn't make mistakes, Blade. It recycles."

| Blade kneels in the rubble. He wipes his bruised, empty hands on his clothes, then reaches into the filth.
| His fingers brush the hilt, and a pulse of faint blue light ripples through the dust.

[BLADE]
"I have no choice.
If I'm going to survive this place, I need something that won't break."

| He grips the hilt. The debris around it seems to shudder and fall away.
| The weapon feels heavy, cold... but as his fingers curl around the worn leather grip, a sudden warmth shoots up his arm.

[NUGGET]
"There it is. The handshake.
That’s the Challenger's Sword.
Found in the dirt, just like you. It fits."

| Blade pulls the sword free from the pile. It slides out with a clean hiss, shedding the grime instantly.
| The metal catches the dim light, shining with an unnatural sharpness.

[BLADE]
(Swinging it experimentally)
"It’s lighter than it looks. Balanced.
It feels... expectant."

[NUGGET]
"It means the Tower has accepted you as a player, not just food.
Bond with it. Because from here on out, that piece of scavenged metal is the only thing standing between you and becoming part of this pile."

| Blade deftly spins the sword and slams it into the scabbard that materializes at his hip. The mechanical click of the lock echoes in the silent hall.

[BLADE]
"Accepted as a player...
Fine. Let's see if the house is ready for me."

[NUGGET]
"That’s the spirit! Now, let's see what that shiny new toy can really do."n.

He swings once — slow, heavy — and the air ripples faintly, as though the Tower itself feels the motion.

[NUGGET](hovering closer) …That wasn’t normal. The Tower just blinked.

[BLADE] (tightens grip) Let it watch.

[NUGGET](forced laugh) Heh… sure! Nothing creepy about a sentient building staring at your sword!

The blade steadies in his hand, faint light tracing along the edge.

[BLADE] Every fight, every scar—it all leads here.

[NUGGET](quietly) Just don’t let it lead you.
