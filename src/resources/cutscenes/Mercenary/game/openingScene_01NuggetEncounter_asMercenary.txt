| Blade steps cautiously toward the shattered window.
| Lying amidst the shards of glass is a small, golden, spherical creature with tiny fluttering wings. It shakes itself off like a wet dog.

[BLADE]
"What... what are you?"

[NUGGET]
"Oh! You noticed me!
Huh...
I guess introductions are in order.
Name's... Nugget. But don't worry about that."

[BLADE]
"..."
"That's not exactly helpful."

[NUGGET]
"Eh, names are overrated anyway.
Important thing is... you seem busy. Or... troubled?"

[BLADE]
"It's none of your concern."

| The creature tilts its head, small wings fluttering, as if thinking.

[NUGGET]
"Hmm... that's rough. Sounds like... you need a big win.
Something that could... change things, dramatically.
But hey, that's just my unsolicited thought."

[BLADE]
"..."
"And you are?"

[NUGGET] "That's not important. Really. Just... someone who notices things. Helps... nudge sometimes. Suggests life-changing advices about fame, status, money ... miracles..." (side-eyes)

| Blade hesitates, observing Nugget, unsure whether to trust it. He glances back at his mother.

[NUGGET]
"If you wanted... a way to really make a difference, maybe there's a path. But... whatever. Ignore me."

| Nugget turns around, pretending to leave through the broken window.

[BLADE]
"..."
"Wait."
"What is it?"

[NUGGET]
(Spinning around instantly, beaming)
"Excellent! That's settled then.
Oh... by the way,
I might tag along.
Nothing creepy. Promise."

[BLADE]
"Hey! I haven't agreed yet."

[NUGGET]
"I only needed your interest.
Plus, a mercenary like you would definitely like this.
About how I know about your profession?
.
.
Uhhm-I know one when I see one?
Come on! Kiss your mother goodbye,
make up with her,
and follow me!"

| Blade stands frozen for a moment, the creature's offer hanging in the air like a lifeline.
