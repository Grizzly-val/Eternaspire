| Blade stands before a gate made of weeping blue stone. The air here isn't just cold; it's heavy, pressing against his chest like deep water.
| He holds The Cryo Sigil, the jagged rune found among Vorthos' treasures. It is small, but his arm strains to lift it.

[BLADE]
"This key... it weighs a ton.
It's just a piece of ice, but it feels like holding a lead brick."

[NUGGET]
"That's because it's not just ice. It's weight.
Vorthos didn't just freeze people; he froze their regrets. That key is dense with things left unsaid."

| Blade inserts the heavy sigil into the lock. It doesn't click. It sighs.
| The massive stone doors slide open silently. The howling wind of the Glacial Gates cuts off instantly, replaced by a suffocating, dead silence.

[BLADE]
"The wind stopped.
It's unnaturally quiet in there."

[NUGGET]
(Hovering lower than usual, her voice subdued)
"Welcome to Floor 6: The Sanctum of Sorrow.
The cold out here freezes your body. The cold in there... it freezes your will.
...And something else. I can feel a presence. Something... achingly familiar."

| Nugget drifts closer to the opening, her blue light dimming as if afraid to shine too brightly.

[NUGGET]
"Keep moving, Blade. If you stop to think in there, you might never start moving again."

| Blade steps across the threshold. The floor is black ice, reflecting a ceiling that isn't there.
