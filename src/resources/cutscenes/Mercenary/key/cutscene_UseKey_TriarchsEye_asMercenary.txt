| Blade stands before a wall of swirling, impenetrable static. The void here screams with the voices of deleted files and forgotten histories.
| He holds up The Triarch's Eye. It is a gem that looks uncomfortably organic, swiveling frantically in his grip as if searching for a signal.

[BLADE]
"This thing... we found it floating in the debris, but it feels alive.
It’s trying to look through the static."

[NUGGET]
(Hovering low, her wings drooping, avoiding looking at the path ahead)
"It’s a relic from a higher floor. It fell down here when the reality started collapsing.
It sees the truth, Blade. If you look through it... the static will clear. You'll see the path to The Final Nexus."

[BLADE]
"The center of the collapse.
That's where the next Echo is."

| Nugget shivers violently. Her blue light flickers, dimming to a nervous violet. She hugs her tiny arms around herself.

[NUGGET]
"Yeah. The Nexus.
...Hey, Blade? Do you feel that? It feels... heavy.
Like walking into a room where someone just stopped crying."

[BLADE]
"It feels like pressure. Like the air is getting denser.
You're trembling."

[NUGGET]
"It's not the cold. It's... guilt.
Whoever is in there... he's leaking so much sadness it's drowning out the noise of the void.
I don't know who he is, but my chest hurts just standing here. I... I really don't want to open this door."

[BLADE]
"We have to. It's the only way up."

| The chaotic wall dissolves, revealing a singular, lonely platform floating in the absolute center of the nothingness. A figure kneels there, motionless in prayer.

[BLADE]
"There's someone kneeling there.
He looks... familiar."

[NUGGET]
(Whispering, shrinking behind Blade's shoulder)
"He looks like he's been waiting for a miracle that never came.
...Let's go. Before I lose my nerve."
