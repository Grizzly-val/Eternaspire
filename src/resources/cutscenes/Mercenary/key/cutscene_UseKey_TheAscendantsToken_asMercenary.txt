| Blade stands before the massive gate leading to the upper spire. The metal is cold and etched with the same sorrowful patterns as the Vanguard's armor.
| He holds the Ascendant's Token in his palm. It feels heavier than it looks, humming with a low, steady vibration.

[NUGGET]
"Go on. It won't bite.
That token is your hall pass. It tells the Tower you didn't just survive-you conquered."

[BLADE]
"It feels heavy.
Like I'm carrying the weight of the one who dropped it."

[NUGGET]
"That's the point.
You overcame the first hurdle, Blade. The Tower respects that.
It's not just a key; it's a receipt for the fight."

| Blade places the token into the circular recess on the gate. The metal absorbs it instantly.
| The gate groans, the heavy bars retracting with a sound like a deep breath being released.
| Beyond lies a steep, spiraling ramp that seems to stretch infinitely upward.

[BLADE]
"The path is open.
Floor 2: The Lower Ascent."

[NUGGET]
"The tutorial is over, kid. The air gets thinner from here.
Hope your lungs are ready."

| Blade steps forward, leaving the empty platform of the Vanguard behind.
