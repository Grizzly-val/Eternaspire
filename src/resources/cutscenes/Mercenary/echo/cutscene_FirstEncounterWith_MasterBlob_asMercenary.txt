[BLADE]
"You...
You're the Tower Master?
You look like the thing I killed on Floor 0. Just... bigger."

[TOWER MASTER]
(The blob doesn't have a mouth, but a voice vibrates directly into Blade's skull. It sounds bored, like a tired administrator.)
"An Elemental Blob? Please. Do not insult the architecture.
Those things downstairs are just... shed skin. Autopilots. Drones I set to 'wander' while I work."

| The Master shifts shape, forming a vague, liquid hand that gestures around the room.

[TOWER MASTER]
"I am the Prime State. The sum of all variables.
And you are the variable that broke my favorite caretaker. Epochra was expensive to train, you know."

[BLADE]
"She wanted to be free. They all do.
I'm here to finish what she started.
Free the Echoes. Release the souls you've trapped in this museum.
And... I want my wish. You promised a wish to anyone who reached the top."

[TOWER MASTER]
(The blob sighs—a sound like steam escaping a pipe.)
"The wish... right. The marketing campaign.
Look, kid. I can't rewrite reality to cure your mom. That’s biologically complex and administratively a nightmare.
But..."

| The Master reaches into its gelatinous body and pulls out a heavy, dripping sack. It lands on the sterile floor with a wet splat.
| Coins spill out. Platinum. Gold. Gems that don't exist on the surface. They are covered in viscous, rainbow-colored slime.

[TOWER MASTER]
"Here. Money. Infinite wealth.
Buy the best doctors. Buy a new kingdom. Whatever.
It’s a little sticky, but it spends the same."

[BLADE]
(Staring at the wet sack)
"You're bribing me?"

[TOWER MASTER]
"I'm paying you to leave.
Look, this won't be easy for me, but I can erase you from existence right here, right now. Poof. Gone.
But see these monitors? See this equipment? It’s sacred. If we fight, things break. And I hate recalibrating the reality engine.
So... take the wet gold. Descend the tower. Live a long, happy, wealthy life.
Go on. Shoo."

| Blade looks at the gold. He thinks of the hospital bills. He thinks of the struggle.
| Then he looks at the screens showing the trapped souls—the Paladin, the Knight, Aeliana... Nugget.
| He kicks the sack of gold aside. It slides across the floor, leaving a trail of slime.

[BLADE]
"Keep your money.
I'm not here to negotiate. I'm here to file a complaint."

| He raises his weapon. The hired blade hums, eager to cut something that thinks it's eternal.

[BLADE]
"And I'm going to file it with this sword."

[TOWER MASTER]
(The colors inside the blob swirl violently, turning a deep, angry crimson.)
"Sigh.
Everyone thinks they're the exception.
Fine. If you want to be erased, I'll do it manually.
Try not to bleed on the consoles."
