| The Master Blob shudders violently. Its shifting colors turn a muddy, chaotic grey.
| With a wet splat, it loses its form completely, collapsing into a puddle on the control room floor.
| Sparks fly from the damaged consoles around the room. The "sacred" equipment is smoking.

[TOWER MASTER]
(Voice vibrating from the puddle, sounding incredibly annoyed)
"Great. Just great.
Do you have any idea how long it takes to recalibrate a Reality Engine?
Centuries. Literal centuries."

[BLADE]
(Lowering his weapon, breathing hard)
"You're indeed strong... but you're not much of a fighter."

[TOWER MASTER]
"Excuse me? I am the sum of all variables! I am infinite complexity!"

[BLADE]
"Yeah, well, maybe you should have spent less time recalibrating engines and more time actually moving.
You've been sitting in this control room for so long you forgot how to throw a punch.
You're just a shut-in with a god complex."

[TOWER MASTER]
"I... well... hmph.
The variable exceeded the parameters. Congratulations.
You are the most stubborn data point I have ever processed. I was going to make you a centerpiece, but honestly? You're too much trouble to keep on a shelf."

| A small, singular eye forms in the puddle, glaring at Blade. Then, a tentacle of slime pushes the heavy, dripping sack of gold back toward Blade's feet.

[TOWER MASTER]
"Fine. The deal holds. Even if you did wreck the office.
Take the money. It's infinite wealth. It's slimy, yes, but it will buy any doctor, any medicine, any castle you want.
Your mother will be fine. You can pay for her life ten times over."

| Blade looks at the sack. It's disgusting, covered in rainbow slime, but it represents everything he fought for.
| He thinks of the hospital bills. He thinks of the struggle.
| He picks it up. It's heavy.

[BLADE]
"I'll take it.
Money is money. Even if it smells like you."

[TOWER MASTER]
"Excellent. Transaction complete.
Now, please. Get out of my tower.
I have a lot of cleanup to do, and I really don't want to see your face for another millennium."

| The elevator of light reappears. The exit. Blade steps onto it, clutching the sack. Then he stops.

[BLADE]
"One more thing."

[TOWER MASTER]
"What? You have the money! What more do you want?"

[BLADE]
"The Echoes. Aeliana. The Paladin. Nugget.
Let them go.
That wasn't part of the money deal. That's my wish."

[TOWER MASTER]
(The puddle ripples, almost sighing.)
"You greedy little anomaly.
But... since you trashed the containment units anyway... and honestly, I'm tired of their noise in the system...
Fine. System flush initiated.
They're all returning to the cycle. No more loops. Just... peace."

[BLADE]
"Good."

| Blade steps fully onto the elevator. As he descends, he looks back one last time at the grumpy puddle of a god.

[BLADE]
"Nice doing business with you."

[TOWER MASTER]
"Get out!"
