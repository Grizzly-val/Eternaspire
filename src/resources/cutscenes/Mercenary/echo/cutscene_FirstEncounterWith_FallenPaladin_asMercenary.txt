| Blade reaches The Final Nexus. It is a singular platform suspended in the center of the vortex.
| Standing there, kneeling before a shattered altar of light, is a warrior clad in heavy, ornate plate armor.
| The metal is fused to his skin, bubbling and black, but the stance is unmistakable. It is Blade's own resting stance, mirrored perfectly.

[BLADE]
"He stands... like me. Same shifting of weight. Same grip on the weapon.
It feels like looking into a dirty mirror. Kinda weird that I noticed that."

[NUGGET]
(Hovering closer, squinting at the corrupted figure)
"Hey... you two kinda look identical.
Like, same build, same brooding aura. If he wasn't covered in cursed sludge, I'd say you were twins."

| Blade doesn't deny it. He steps forward, hand hovering over his hilt. The resonance is too strong to ignore.

[NUGGET]
(Her wings drooping slightly, a sudden wave of unease hitting her)
"Blade... I don't like this one.
I don't want you to fight him. It feels... wrong. Like kicking a puppy. A really heavily armored, dangerous puppy."

[BLADE]
"He's in the way, Nugget. And he's waiting for me."

[NUGGET]
"I know, I know! But... can't we just talk to him? Maybe he's reasonable?
I just... I really don't want to see you smash him. It feels bad."

| The Paladin slowly turns his head. The visor is melted shut, but a voice rasps out from the darkness within. It is wet, weak, and filled with a heartbreaking gentleness.

[FALLEN PALADIN]
"Nugget...
Bird..."

[NUGGET]
(Freezing)
"He... he knows my name? Why do they always know my name?"

[FALLEN PALADIN]
"Forgive... you...
Friend..."

[NUGGET]
"Forgive me? For what? I never met you!
...Right?"

| The Paladin struggles to his feet, raising the massive Corrupted Redeemer. He isn't attacking out of malice. He is attacking because the Tower demands it, but his soul is weeping.

[BLADE]
(Drawing his weapon)
"He knows you. And he's forgiving you for something you don't remember.
That's not a good sign."

[NUGGET]
(Voice trembling, retreating behind Blade)
"I don't like this floor, Blade.
Just... make it stop. Please."
