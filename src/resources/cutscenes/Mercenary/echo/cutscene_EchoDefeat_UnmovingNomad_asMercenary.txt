| The Unmoving Nomad stumbles. The heavy walking stick clatters to the floor, rolling out of reach.
| The figure drops to its knees. It reaches out with a trembling hand toward the exit gate—the path it stared at for a thousand years but never took.
| It tries to crawl forward, but its spectral form begins to unravel into blue dust.

[BLADE]
(Watching the creature fade)
"He wanted to go through. Even at the end."

[NUGGET]
"Wanting isn't enough.
The Tower doesn't care about your plans, your maps, or your good intentions.
It only cares about will."

| The Nomad dissolves completely. The silence in the room feels heavy.
| Left behind on the stone are a Nomad's Ring and a Skill Scroll.

[NUGGET]
"He failed because he let his curiosity become a cage. He loved the idea of the journey more than the climb itself."

| Nugget hovers over the loot, his voice dropping just an octave lower, sounding less like a guide and more like a judge.

[NUGGET]
"Pathetic. To be so close and stop because you were afraid to commit.
Pick up the ring, Blade.
Let's prove we're better than it."

[BLADE]
(Picking up the Nomad's Ring)
"You sound angry at him."

[NUGGET]
(Snapping back to his cheerful persona instantly)
"Angry? No! Just... disappointed!
I hate seeing wasted potential. Now come on!
That ring unlocks the desert. I hear the weather there is terrible!"
