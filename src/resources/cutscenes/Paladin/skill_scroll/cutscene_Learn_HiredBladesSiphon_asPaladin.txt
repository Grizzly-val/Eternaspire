| Percival unfurls the scroll found among the Nomad's belongings. Unlike the others, this one isn't made of parchment. It looks like a formal contract stamped on cured leather.
| The text glows with a harsh, red ink.

[PERCIVAL]
"'Daunting Contract.'
This doesn't look like a spell. It looks like a bill of sale."

[NUGGET]
"That's because it is!
It's an old mercenary pact. Hired Blade's Siphon.
It operates on a simple rule: 'If I bleed you, I get paid.'
Except the payment isn't gold. It's life."

| Percival touches the contract. The red ink liquefies, running up his fingers and sinking into his veins. It doesn't feel magical; it feels greedy.

[PERCIVAL]
(Flexing his hand, feeling a sudden, selfish hunger)
"I can feel it.
When I hit something... I want to take everything they have.
It turns damage into sustenance."

[NUGGET]
"A perfect skill for a professional!
Why rely on potions when you can just steal your enemy's health?
It's efficient, brutal, and ethically questionable. Just your style!"

[PERCIVAL]
"Ethical or not, if it keeps me standing, I'll sign."
