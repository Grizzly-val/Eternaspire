| Percival holds the shimmering blue scroll. It feels cold, like holding a handful of river water. |

[PERCIVAL] "Magic... I've never relied on spells. Steel is reliable. This feels... temporary."

[NUGGET] "Hence the name, 'Fleeting Aid.' I told you earlier you'd need healing. You take too many hits, Percival. You can't just grit your teeth through everything."

[PERCIVAL]"I've survived this long without it."

[NUGGET] "And your mother is counting on you surviving longer. The Reaper is coming for the bill, remember? Best to have a way to cheat him."

| Percival hesitates, then activates the scroll. A soothing light washes over his bruised knuckles.

[PERCIVAL] "...Fine. It stops the bleeding. That's all that matters."
