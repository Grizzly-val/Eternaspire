| The door to the final chamber is mechanical, covered in pipes and wires that are frosted over.
| In the center is a delicate sensor pad.
| Percival holds The Heartbeat Sensor, a strange clockwork device he salvaged. It ticks slowly. Thump... thump...

[PERCIVAL]
"It's syncing with the door.
It sounds like a dying heart."

[NUGGET]
"It detects the end of a cycle.
This floor... it's where things stop. Where they give up.
The door only opens if it thinks you're ready to stop too."

[PERCIVAL]
"Well, I'm not stopping."

| Percival presses the device to the lock. The mechanism whirs, slowing down until it halts completely.
| The blast doors groan open, releasing a wave of air so cold it burns.

[NUGGET]
(Whispering)
"He's inside.
Nihil.
Don't let him touch you, Percival. He doesn't fight with weapons. He fights with... nothing."
