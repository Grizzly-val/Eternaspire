| Percival stands before a seamless wall of dark obsidian ice. There is no door, only a geometric indentation.
| He holds up The Black Ice Prism. When he looks through it, the wall vanishes, revealing a twisting spiral staircase behind it.

[PERCIVAL]
"It’s an illusion. The prism filters it out.
Clever."

[NUGGET]
(Quietly)
"It’s not an illusion. It’s a memory of a wall.
The prism just reminds it that it's broken."

[PERCIVAL]
"That sounds poetic. And depressing.
You're usually making a joke about breaking and entering by now."

[NUGGET]
"This floor... it’s heavy.
Just put the prism in the slot, Percival. Let's get out of this hallway."

| Percival inserts the prism. The dark ice shatters silently, the shards dissolving into mist before they hit the floor.
