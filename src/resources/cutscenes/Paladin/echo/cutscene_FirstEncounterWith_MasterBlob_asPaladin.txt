[PERCIVAL]
"You...
You're the Tower Master?
You look like the thing I killed on Floor 0. Just... bigger."

[TOWER MASTER]
(The blob doesn't have a mouth, but a voice vibrates directly into Percival's skull. It sounds bored, like a tired administrator.)
"An Elemental Blob? Please. Do not insult the architecture.
Those things downstairs are just... shed skin. Autopilots. Drones I set to 'wander' while I work."

| The Master shifts shape, forming a vague, liquid hand that gestures around the room.

[TOWER MASTER]
"I am the Prime State. The sum of all variables.
And you are the variable that broke my favorite caretaker. Epochra was expensive to train, you know."

[PERCIVAL]
"She wanted to be free. They all do.
I'm here to finish what she started.
Free the Echoes. Release the souls you've trapped in this museum.
And... I want my wish. You promised a wish to anyone who reached the top."

[TOWER MASTER]
(The blob sighs-a sound like steam escaping a pipe.)
"The wish... right. The marketing campaign.
Look, kid. I can't rewrite reality to bring your mother back. That's metaphysically complex and bureaucratically awful.
But..."

| The Master reaches into its gelatinous body and pulls out a heavy, dripping sack. It lands on the sterile floor with a wet splat.
| Coins spill out. Platinum. Gold. Gems that don't exist on the surface. They are covered in viscous, rainbow-colored slime.

[TOWER MASTER]
"Here. Wealth. Infinite wealth.
Buy yourself a kingdom. Buy yourself distractions. Buy whatever you think will fill the hole she left.
It's a little sticky, but it spends the same."

[PERCIVAL]
(Staring at the wet sack)
"You're bribing me?"

[TOWER MASTER]
"I'm paying you to leave.
Look, this won't be easy for me, but I can erase you from existence right here, right now. Poof. Gone.
But see these monitors? This equipment? It's sacred. If we fight, things break. And I hate recalibrating the reality engine.
So... take the wet gold. Walk out of here. Live a long, wealthy life.
Go on. Shoo."

| Percival looks at the gold. He thinks of all the years without her. The emptiness.
| Then he looks at the screens showing the trapped souls-the Paladin, the Knight, Aeliana... Nugget.
| He kicks the sack of gold aside. It slides across the floor, leaving a trail of slime.

[PERCIVAL]
"Keep your money.
I didn't climb this tower for a payout.
I'm not here to bargain. I'm here to end this."

| He raises his weapon. The hired blade hums, eager to cut something that thinks it cannot die.

[PERCIVAL]
"And I'm shutting you down."

If you'd like, I can also:

 make it darker
 make it more emotional about the mother
 add flashbacks
 punch up the comedy
 shorten/lengthen it
Just tell me the tone you're aiming for!

You said:
add some more and revise as you wish, this is kind of a different character. But don't change the overall flow
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely - here is an expanded, polished version that keeps the exact same flow, but deepens character, tension, and emotional stakes.
I treated Percival as slightly colder, more focused, and the Tower Master as more unnervingly condescending.

Revised & Expanded Cutscene (Same Flow, Stronger Character)

[PERCIVAL]
"You...
You're the Tower Master?
You look like the thing I killed on Floor 0. Just... inflated."

[TOWER MASTER]
(The blob's surface ripples like someone exhaling through water. Its voice vibrates directly into Percival's skull, dry and irritated.)
"Those? Please. Those were maintenance husks.
I shed them the way humans shed skin cells. A necessary byproduct of running a tower this... ambitious."

| The Master folds into itself, reshaping into a rough humanoid silhouette, as if trying to be polite but not really understanding how anatomy works.

[TOWER MASTER]
"I am the Prime State. The sum of all equations.
And you... are the anomaly that broke my best caretaker.
Epochra was difficult to cultivate. You can't imagine the cost."

[PERCIVAL]
"I know she was tired. I know she wanted to be free.
Everyone down there does.
I came to finish what she couldn't.
Free the Echoes you've hoarded...
And claim the wish you promised anyone who reached the top."

| The blob freezes for a moment-then releases a slow, metallic groan that might be a sigh.

[TOWER MASTER]
"Ah. The wish. The promotional gimmick.
Mortals love quests with prizes. Motivation in a box.
But reviving your mother?
That's not a wish, boy. That's a rewrite of causality.
Even I would need clearance for that."

| It reaches into its own shimmering body and pulls out a dripping sack. It hits the pristine floor with a nauseating whump.
| Gold coins, radiant shards, impossible gems spill across the ground like a spilled galaxy.

[TOWER MASTER]
"Take this instead. Infinite wealth.
Buy comfort. Buy distraction. Buy a life where grief gets drowned in luxury.
It is sticky, yes, but mortals are so good at overlooking slime when gold is involved."

[PERCIVAL]
(Hands at his sides. No movement. Frost in his eyes.)
"So you're bribing me."

[TOWER MASTER]
"I am paying you to leave.
Because while I can erase you-believe me, it would take less effort than blinking-
you see this chamber? These instruments?
They keep reality stitched and calibrated.
A fight risks... damage. And I despise repairs."

| Percival glances at the scattered treasure.
| For a heartbeat he sees his mother's face-still, silent, unreachable.
| Then his gaze lifts to the suspended Echoes on the monitors: the Paladin, the Knight, Aeliana... Nugget... trapped in loops they never chose.

| His jaw tightens.
| He kicks the sack of gold; it slides across the floor, leaving a rainbow-slick smear.

[PERCIVAL]
"Keep your money.
I didn't climb this tower to be bought.
And I didn't come to negotiate."

| His weapon rises, humming with killing intent, reflecting the tower's pale lights.

[PERCIVAL]
"I came to end your museum of stolen souls.
And tonight, Tower Master-"

| He steps forward, eyes sharp as broken glass.

[PERCIVAL]
"-I'm shutting you down."
