| The Master Blob convulses violently.
| It collapses into a puddle, consoles sparking and smoking around the room.

[TOWER MASTER]
"Great. Just great.
Do you have any idea how long a Reality Engine takes to recalibrate?
Centuries. Literal centuries."

[PERCIVAL]
"Strong... but not much of a fighter."

[TOWER MASTER]
"Excuse me? I am the sum of all variables! I am infinite complexity!"

[PERCIVAL]
"Yeah, well, maybe you should've spent less time calibrating engines
and more time learning how to move.
You're just a shut-in with a god complex."

[TOWER MASTER]
"Hmph.
The variable exceeded its parameters.
Congratulations.
You're the most stubborn data point I've ever processed.
I was going to make you a centerpiece, but honestly?
You're too much trouble."

| A small eye forms in the puddle. A tentacle pushes a slimy sack of gold toward Percival.

[TOWER MASTER]
"Fine. The deal holds.
Take the money. Infinite wealth. Sticky but universal.
Use it as proof-
proof you cleared Eternaspire.
Flash that in any kingdom, and even the most stubborn parent would have no choice but to acknowledge you."

| Percival stares at the sack.

[PERCIVAL]
"...Proof, huh?"

| He picks it up. It's heavy.

[PERCIVAL]
"I'll take it.
Money is money.
Even if it smells like you."

[TOWER MASTER]
"Excellent. Transaction complete.
Now get out. I have a millennium of cleanup to do."

| The elevator of light forms. Percival steps on-then pauses.

[PERCIVAL]
"One more thing."

[TOWER MASTER]
"What now? You have the money! What more do you want?"

[PERCIVAL]
"The Echoes. Aeliana. The Paladin. Nugget.
Let them go.
That's my wish."

[TOWER MASTER]
(The puddle ripples, sounding exhausted.)
"You greedy little anomaly...
But fine.
You broke half the containment units anyway.
System flush initiated.
They will return to the cycle.
No more loops.
Just peace."

[PERCIVAL]
"Good."

| He steps onto the elevator fully, looking back one last time.

[PERCIVAL]
"Nice doing business with you."

[TOWER MASTER]
"GET. OUT."
