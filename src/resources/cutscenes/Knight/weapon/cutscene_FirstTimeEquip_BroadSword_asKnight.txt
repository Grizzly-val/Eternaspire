| Percival kicks aside a pile of loose stones on Floor 2. Beneath the debris, a glint of steel catches the dim light.
| He reaches down and pulls out a Broad Sword. It is simple, sturdy, and unadorned-a weapon for a soldier, not a hero.

[PERCIVAL]
(Weighing the blade in his hand)
"Standard issue. Double-edged. Heavy.
It feels... stiff."

[NUGGET]
"That's a Broad Sword.
It's not stiff, it's disciplined.
That piece of metal probably belonged to a castle guard or a knight before it ended up in this dump. It remembers drills, formations, and saluting."

| Percival gives it a test swing. The motion is clean, but halfway through, he unconsciously straightens his back, correcting his slouch into a rigid, defensive posture.

[PERCIVAL]
"Weird.
When I hold it, I feel like... I need to follow rules.
It doesn't want to fight dirty. It wants to duel."

[NUGGET]
"That's the resonance!
Weapons in the Tower hold the habits of their owners.
That sword is used to honor and protecting the king.
A bit fancy for a mercenary who throws sand in people's eyes, don't you think?"

[PERCIVAL]
(Relaxing his stance, forcing the weapon to hang casually by his side)
"Yeah. I don't do 'honor.' I do 'survival.'
But the steel is good, and it has better reach than the Challenger's Sword.
I guess I can learn to be a little... chivalrous. Until I need to kick someone in the teeth."

[NUGGET]
"That's the spirit! Use the reach, ignore the manners.
Let's see if that knightly steel can handle a real fight."
