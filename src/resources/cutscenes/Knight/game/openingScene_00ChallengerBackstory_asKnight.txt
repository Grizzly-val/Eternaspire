| Before there were stories, there was a fracture.
| Some say the world split by accident. Others whisper it was carved open on purpose.
| No one agrees-only that something tore the sky from its reflection.

| From that wound rose a structure no one remembers building.
| A tower older than memory, taller than truth.
| It calls to those who have everything, yet feel they have nothing.

| ...

| The setting is a grand, cold hall adorned with banners of House Sterling.
| A young Knight, Percival, kneels on the polished stone floor, head bowed. His armor is gleaming, dented from a fresh victory.
| He holds up a golden wreath-a symbol of the highest tournament honor.

[PERCIVAL]
"Mother. I have returned.
The Grand Tourney... I won. I defeated the General's son in the final bout."

| A woman sits on a high-backed chair. She does not look at the wreath. She is reading a letter, her expression impassive.

[PERCIVAL'S MOTHER]
"The General's son is a sloppy fencer. Defeating him is the baseline, not an achievement."

[PERCIVAL]
(His hands trembling slightly, lowering the wreath)
"I... I trained for months. I didn't sleep. I mastered the-"

[PERCIVAL'S MOTHER]
"And?
You are a Sterling. Excellence is the requirement of your birth, not a favor you do for me.
Do not expect applause for doing what you are supposed to do."

| She finally looks at him. Her eyes are cold, dissecting him like a flaw in a diamond.

[PERCIVAL'S MOTHER]
"Your brother was a captain at your age. You are still playing games for trophies.
Stand up. You look pathetic kneeling there waiting for a treat."

[PERCIVAL]
"I just wanted you to see me."

[PERCIVAL'S MOTHER]
"I see you. I see a boy who craves validation more than victory.
It is embarrassing.
Go. Clean your armor. It's filthy."

| She turns back to her letter. Percival stands, the golden wreath crushing in his grip until the metal twists.
| He walks to his chambers, the silence of the hallway deafening.
| He throws the wreath against the wall. It clatters uselessly.

[PERCIVAL]
"Nothing is enough.
I could conquer the world, and she'd ask why I didn't do it faster."

| CRASH!
| "YIKES! That looks expensive!"

| Something smashes through the stained-glass window, rolling across the expensive rug.
