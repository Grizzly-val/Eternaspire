| Percival holds a piece of... something. It's thin, golden-brown, and brittle.
| It fell off the Skinless he just defeated.

[PERCIVAL]
( grimacing)
"This is... skin.
You want me to eat flakey, frozen skin?"

[NUGGET]
"Don't think of it as skin! Think of it as... 'forbidden pork rinds.'
It's pure experience, Percival! That monster spent centuries burning with fever. That energy is trapped in the... er... crust."

[PERCIVAL]
"I hate this place."

| Percival takes a bite. It crunches loudly.
| A rush of memories that aren't his floods his mind-battles fought, pain endured, lessons learned.

[PERCIVAL]
(Blinking rapidly)
"I saw... fighting techniques.
I feel stronger. Smarter.
But I still want to vomit."

[NUGGET]
"Knowledge tastes terrible, doesn't it?
But hey, free XP!"
