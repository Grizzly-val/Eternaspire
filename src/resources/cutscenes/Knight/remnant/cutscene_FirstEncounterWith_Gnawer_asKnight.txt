| The silence of the void is broken by a wet, grinding sound. Skritch. Crunch.
| Percival freezes on the narrow walkway. Ahead, a shadow detaches itself from the underside of a floating platform.
| It scuttles into the dim light—a hunched, hairless creature with elongated limbs and a jaw that unhinges, revealing rows of jagged, rusted teeth.

[PERCIVAL]
(Low voice, hand tightening on his sword)
"That's not just a rat. Look at its teeth... they're chewing through the stone."

[NUGGET]
(Whispering, unusually tense)
"That’s a Gnawer.
They scavenge the dead, Percival. But if they get impatient... they scavenge the living."

| The creature snaps its head toward them. Its eyes are milky white, blind but locking onto the sound of their heartbeats. It lets out a high-pitched, vibrating shriek.

[PERCIVAL]
"It knows we're here.
This isn't a mindless slime. It's hunting."

[NUGGET]
"Don't let it bite you. It doesn't stop chewing until it hits bone."

| Percival shifts his stance, the Challenger's Sword humming in response to the threat.

[PERCIVAL]
"Then I'll cut it down before it gets the chance."
