| Percival walks across a vast, frozen lake. The ice is thick but transparent, revealing a dark, abyssal ocean beneath.
| Something moves under his boots. A pale, bloated face presses up against the ice from below, staring directly at him.

[PERCIVAL]
(Drawing his weapon and stepping back)
"There's something under the floor.
It's tracking us."

[NUGGET]
"Not under... inside.
That's a Drowner.
They swim through the ice like it's water.
Don't look at their eyes, Percival. They want you to join them in the deep."

| The ice beneath Percival erupts. A water-logged, rotting hand shoots up, grabbing for his ankle.

[PERCIVAL]
"It's phasing through!
Get back!"

[NUGGET]
"Pop it! Pop the bloated fish!"
