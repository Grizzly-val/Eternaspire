| Blade finds a scroll made of thin, fire-resistant copper foil resting on a frozen pedestal.
| It is warm to the touch, melting the frost beneath it.

[CHALLENGER]
"This scroll... it’s etched into metal.
'To burn is to live. To steal warmth is to survive.'"

[NUGGET]
"Ooh, Thermal Siphon!
That’s a nasty little trick. It lets you drain the heat right out of an enemy.
You burn them, and the energy heals you. It’s vampirism, but spicy."

| Blade touches the copper sheet. It dissolves into sparks that sink into his skin.
| He feels a strange hunger in his palms—a desire to touch something hot and drink the energy.

[CHALLENGER]
(Looking at his hand, which now glows faintly red)
"I can feel the heat in the air.
Instead of burning me... it feels like fuel."

[NUGGET]
"Useful in a place where everything is frozen.
Just don't burn your tongue."
