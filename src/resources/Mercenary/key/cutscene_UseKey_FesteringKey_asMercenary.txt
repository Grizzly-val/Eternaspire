| Blade stands before a door that looks like a healing wound—fleshy, scabbed over, and pulsing.
| He holds The Festering Key. It is covered in living rust that squirms against his gloves. It feels feverishly hot.

[CHALLENGER]
"This key... it's alive. And sick.
The lock looks like a sore."

[NUGGET]
"That’s the entrance to The Festering Core.
The corruption is thickest there. It’s where the Tower dumps the things it can't fix.
Insert the key. Try not to think about the squelching sound."

| Blade grimaces and pushes the rusting key into the soft, yielding center of the door.
| SQUELCH.
| The door shudders and peels open like an eyelid, revealing a room bathed in sick neon light.

[NUGGET]
(Floating back, hesitant)
"She’s in there.
I can feel the sorrow leaking out. It tastes like ash."

[CHALLENGER]
"Who?"

[NUGGET]
"Just... be ready. This one isn't a monster. She's a tragedy."
