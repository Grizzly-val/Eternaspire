| Blade picks up the weapon. It is a thin, spear-like lance made of an unknown, transparent metal.
| It feels weightless, yet impossibly rigid.

[CHALLENGER]
"It’s a needle.
It doesn't have an edge, just a point. A point so sharp it hurts to look at."

[NUGGET]
"That’s The Curator's Needle.
It’s not for slashing. It’s for pinpoint precision.
It seeks out the weak points—the cracks in the armor, the gaps in the ribs.
Vorthos used it to pin butterflies. You'll use it to pin monsters."

| Blade thrusts the weapon. It hums, leaving a trail of frozen air.

[CHALLENGER]
"It hums. It wants to find a heart to stop."

[NUGGET]
"Creepy. Effective.
Just how we like it."
