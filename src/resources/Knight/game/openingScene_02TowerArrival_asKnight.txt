| Percival stands at the gates of the estate. He isn't wearing his ceremonial parade armor. He is wearing his battle plate—scratched, practical, and heavy.
| He looks back at the high window of his mother's study. The light is on. She is still working. She hasn't noticed he's leaving.

[PERCIVAL]
"Goodbye, Mother.
When I come back... you won't have to ask who I am."

| He turns away, the heavy iron gate clanging shut behind him. Nugget hovers by his shoulder.

[NUGGET]
"Dramatic exit. I rate it a solid 8/10. Needs more cape fluttering."

[PERCIVAL]
"Let's just go."

| ...

| They stand before the Tower. It pierces the clouds, a monument to impossibility.
| Percival feels a chill that has nothing to do with the wind.

[PERCIVAL]
"It looms. It feels... arrogant."

[NUGGET]
"It's the ultimate challenge. It judges everyone.
But unlike your mom, if you beat this thing, it stays beaten."

| The massive doors groan open. Darkness awaits.
| They step inside. The doors slam shut.
| The blue lights of Floor 0 flicker to life.

[PERCIVAL]
"Floor 0. 'The Beginning of No End.'
Fitting."

| He reaches for his sidearm.
| His hand grasps air.
| He looks down. His sword is gone. His shield is gone. Even his fine plate armor has dissolved into a simple tunic and trousers.

[PERCIVAL]
"My... my gear!
That armor was forged by the Royal Smith! My sword was an heirloom!"

[NUGGET]
"And now it's a snack!
The Tower eats outside metal. Call it an entry tax.
You wanted to prove yourself? Well, now you have to do it from scratch.
No family crest. No expensive steel. Just you. Call it entry tax."

[PERCIVAL]
(Looking at his bare hands, panic rising)
"I... I am nothing without my crest."

[NUGGET]
"Wrong. You're a player now.
And players level up.
Welcome to the game, Sir Knight."
