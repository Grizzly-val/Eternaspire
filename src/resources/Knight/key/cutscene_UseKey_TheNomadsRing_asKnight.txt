| Percival stands before the heavy gate leading up to the next floor. It is sealed by a circular stone plate with a small, smooth indentation in the center. |

He pulls out The Nomad’s Ring, a dull silver band found with the Echo's remains.

[PERCIVAL] "This ring... it's just old and scuffed. But it feels different from the other keys. It's warm, almost thankful."

[NUGGET] "It's a piece of the Nomad's final journey. He gave up his body for the Tower, but he kept his desire to explore. That ring is showing you his final discovery."

| Percival places the ring into the indentation. It melts instantly into a burst of golden light, which rushes up the gate and forms a single, elegant glyph.

| The gate swings open silently, revealing a short passage that quickly gives way to a shocking vista. A hot, dry gust of wind blows sand and fine grit into the hall. |

Beyond the doorway is a vast, open-air desert, complete with towering, crumbling dunes and the ruin of an ancient city—all contained somehow within the confines of the Tower.

[PERCIVAL] (Stopping dead in his tracks, shielding his eyes from the sudden, intense heat and light) "A... a desert? We're inside a tower, Nugget! How is there a whole desert in here? Where is the sun coming from?"

[NUGGET] (Hovering in the shade of the archway, his voice taking on a knowing, almost teasing quality) "The Tower is... flexible, Percival. It’s not just a big building. Think of it less like a tower and more like a spine. A spine that pierces through a lot of very interesting places. It collects not just souls, but environments."

| Percival looks back at the cold stone floor they just left, then out at the scorching sand. The absurdity of it visibly unnerves him more than the monsters did. |

[PERCIVAL] "A spine...? So this whole thing... is not supposed to be here."

[NUGGET] "Correct! Welcome to the The Ruined Kingdom of Neferis. Try to keep up, Challenger. The reality you left behind is already far, far away."

[PERCIVAL] (Stepping out onto the burning sand, his boots sinking slightly) "Just a little further up. It doesn't matter what I have to walk through."
