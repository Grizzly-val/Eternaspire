The mercenary trudges along a desolate field. The air is heavy with fog, and in the distance, a massive silhouette pierces the sky — the Tower.

He reaches a broken archway. The ground pulses faintly beneath him.

CHALLENGER: (to himself) So this is it. The place fools die chasing miracles.

??? (cheerful, echoing voice): That’s one way to greet your savior!

CHALLENGER: (draws weapon) Who’s there?!

A small sphere of golden light bobs out from the mist, then reshapes into a tiny floating creature — half mechanical, half ethereal. Its eyes flicker like lanterns.

NUGGET: Ta-daa! Name’s Nugget! Your lucky charm, guide, and all-around emotional support companion!

CHALLENGER: …A talking lamp?

NUGGET: Rude. I’m a certified Tower assistant. You look like someone in desperate need of one.

CHALLENGER: I didn’t ask for help.

NUGGET: Sure you did. Every fool who touches the Tower’s door whispers for help. Some cry, some pray, some just curse the world. Yours was more of a “gritty silence,” but I got the message.

The mercenary glares but lowers his blade.

CHALLENGER: So what’s the price? You tower things always want something.

NUGGET: (smiles) Just your company.

The air hums as the Tower’s massive doors begin to creak open.

NUGGET: Let’s go, partner. The climb begins now.
